"""Proposed actions: read the briefing's "Proposed actions" section and remember decisions.

The scheduled briefing task (README: "Instructions for the Claude briefing
task") writes one line per proposal under a heading named
"Proposed actions". Two line formats are read:

    Calendar: <title> | <when> | <repeat> | <where> | <notes>
    <Kind>: key=value | key=value | ... | body=<text>

The second one (README: "Proposed actions format") is for the other kinds:
Reply, Email, RSVP, Move, Cancel, Share, Slack, Todo and Open. A line is read
that way only when its label is exactly one of those kinds and its first field
is a key that kind knows; every other line ("Reply: Carol about the draft")
goes through the Calendar / free-text path exactly as before.

    parse_action_line(text)    one line -> ProposedAction (never raises)
    extract_actions(lines)     pull that section out of a page's FlatLines
    link_allowed(url)          the https hosts a card's Open may open
    web_link_allowed(url)      a web research card's link: any public https host (public_host_problem)
    card_view(action, today)   what a card shows (kind label, texts, buttons)
    edit_action(action, ...)   the Edit dialog's changes to an RSVP, Move or Cancel, checked
                               like a line (same id)
    edit_mail(action, ...)     the Edit dialog's changes to a Reply or Email (recipients,
                               subject, body, confirmed new recipients; same id)
    parse_time_range(d, s, e)  the Edit dialog's new time for a Move, read like when=
    email_address(text)        one address as Jarvis sends to it ("" when it is not one)
    due_words(action, today)   "due today" / "due Wed Oct 7, 11:59 PM" (a Reply / Email card's detail)
    ActionStore(path)          persisted decisions (created / exists / denied / done /
                               failed / sent / running / unknown)

Jarvis carries out these kinds after Approve (COUNTDOWN_KINDS): a Calendar line
(create the event), a Todo with a block= time (add that block), an RSVP, Move
or Cancel (answer the invitation, move or cancel the event; EVENT_KINDS), and a
Reply or Email (send it through Gmail; MAIL_KINDS). Each goes through the undo
countdown first and has "running" saved right before its one call
(executor.py, ui.py). The other kinds are hand-offs: their cards open the
source link, copy the drafted text and record Done or Deny, and nothing is
sent. Free-text lines and lines that cannot be read stay informational;
``error`` says why a line could not be read. Nothing here talks to Google:
gcal.py and gmail.py do that, and only after an explicit click on that card.

Qt-free. Briefing content is personal, so only counts, action ids, kinds,
account aliases and statuses are logged, never text, addresses or links.

    """One line of the "Proposed actions" section.

    Timed events have naive ``start``/``end`` in local wall time (the
    calendar's time zone); all-day events have ``all_day_start`` and an
    inclusive ``all_day_end`` instead. ``repeat`` holds normalized words
    ("weekly until 2026-12-11", "daily x 5") and ``rrule`` the matching RRULE
    ("" = one-off). ``error`` says why the line could not be read.

    Lines in the key=value format (``structured``) keep their normalized
    values in ``fields`` (canonical key order, body excluded), the account
    alias in ``account``, an allowlisted https link in ``link``, the drafted
    text in ``body`` and soft problems in ``warnings``. ``start``/``end`` are
    a Todo's block or a Move's new time; ``title`` is the card headline.
    ``confirmed`` holds the NEW RECIPIENT addresses of a Reply / Email that you
    ticked in the Edit dialog (casefolded; set only by edit_mail, never by a
    line, kept in memory only).

    ``source`` says who proposed it: the briefing page (SOURCE_BRIEFING, every
    line of extract_actions) or Ask Jarvis (SOURCE_ASK). It is not part of the
    id, so the same proposal from both has one id (and one decision).
    ``unverified`` holds the recipients of an Ask Reply / Email that you did not
    type yourself (casefolded; memory only): each counts as NEW, even in a
    trusted domain, unless Jarvis sent to it before (recipients.review).
    ``web`` marks a web research card (an Open card for a source, a Todo with a
    source's link): its link is checked with the web rule (web_link_allowed:
    any public https host) instead of the Open allowlist, when it is read and
