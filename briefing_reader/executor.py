"""Carrying out approved proposals: which service acts for which account, and how.

    Executor(backends, accounts)   picks the backend for a proposal: its kind and the
                                   ``[accounts.<alias>]`` table of its account in config.toml
    CalendarBackend(calendars)     Google Calendar, one gcal.GoogleCalendar per account alias:
                                   a Calendar event or a Todo's block (always the "personal"
                                   calendar, as before), and an RSVP, Move or Cancel (the line's
                                   ``acct=``)
    GmailBackend(senders, ...)     Gmail (gmail.send), one gmail.GmailSender per alias: a Reply or
                                   an Email from the line's ``acct=``, after the recipient check
    run_action(executor, action)   one job of the action worker: with ``writes_running`` (the
                                   undo countdown ran out) "running" is saved before the call and
                                   the result after it; a Reply or Email is sent only that way.
                                   ``live`` (an approved card's LIVE view task): its last checks,
                                   sign-in, the exact payload and the call, as they happen
    preview(action)                Executor: what execute would send or change (live.Payload; no
                                   network, never a sign-in), for the LIVE view during the countdown
    mail_status(action)            Executor: what a Reply / Email card shows (From, recipients,
                                   why it can't send yet) and what its Send click does
    pending_confirmation(alias)    Executor: a new binding you have not confirmed yet ("Signed in
                                   as X for 'personal' - is that right?"); nothing is sent or
                                   changed for that alias until confirm_account(), and
                                   disconnect() is "No, use another account"
    change_problem(alias)          Executor: why nothing may be changed for the alias although it
                                   is signed in (fails closed: also a saved sign-in Jarvis has no
                                   binding for, which signs in again)
    build_accounts(config)         one google_auth.GoogleAccount per alias (the single sign-in
                                   of older versions becomes "personal"), bound via accounts.json
    build_calendars(config)        one gcal.GoogleCalendar per alias that has the calendar feature
    build_senders(config)          one gmail.GmailSender per alias that has the gmail_send feature
    build_executor(config, ...)    the Executor of both backends (recipients.json for the history)
    apply_edit(action, edit)       the Edit dialog's changes (memory only; same id)
    check_event(action, details)   the card's check line: Google's own title, time and organizer,
                                   and whether Jarvis may act on that event
    sign_in_note(alias, ...)       what a card says while its account cannot be used

``readiness`` answers without the network or a sign-in why a proposal cannot be
carried out ("" when it can). ``prepare`` signs the account in when needed (a
browser sign-in, only ever after a click; never for email: the card's Send
signs in first, so its From line shows the account before any countdown);
``execute`` makes the one call and returns an ExecResult or raises ExecError,
whose ``outcome`` says whether the change certainly did not happen ("failed")
or may have happened ("unknown": never retried by itself). ``peek`` reads the
event without ever signing in. Nothing here retries a change: a Retry is a new
click on the card, and one approval sends at most one email
(google_auth.single_send_http).

Composio is a seam only: ``backend = "composio"`` is accepted by config.py and
answered here with "Composio is not built into this version"; a later backend
implements the same small protocol and nothing else changes.

Qt-free and blocking (callers use the worker thread). Logs name only action
ids, kinds, account aliases ("work", "personal", else "other"), statuses and
HTTP status codes. The LIVE view (``live=``) only shows what happens: with or
without it every status, store write, exception and log line is the same. A
calendar change shows the exact request gcal sends (its ``on_request`` hook,
only on gcal.GoogleCalendar), checked against what the countdown showed
(``request_differs``); when Google already had the change nothing was sent and
the steps say so (NOTHING SENT, ALREADY ...).
