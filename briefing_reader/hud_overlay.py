"""Jarvis on your desktop: the HUD's windows (SPEC section 8.1; Phase 1, part 3; DesktopB.dc.html, Switch.dc.html).

Qt only. Nothing here reads, opens or changes anything outside Jarvis, and nothing here switches: the app (a later
part) shows and hides these windows and answers their signals. Separate top-level windows by job, never one big
partly click-through window; each is ``Tool | FramelessWindowHint | WindowStaysOnTopHint | WindowDoesNotAcceptFocus``
with ``WA_TranslucentBackground`` and ``WA_ShowWithoutActivating`` (states_view.TOAST_FLAGS): no taskbar button,
never the focus. Their margins are fully transparent, so clicks there reach the desktop (no setMask); every fill is
opaque (``field`` / ``tile``, never a blur), and no window that takes clicks paints a glow or a shadow (any alpha
above 0 catches clicks): the glows live in the DecorLayer - the prototypes' outer shadows and cyan glows of the bar,
the chips and the cards (``Glow``) as well as the brackets and tethers.

``HudWindow``
    The orb (``OrbWidget(ORB_PX)``: the compact level of detail in a 104 px widget, no ground, never resized per
    frame) over the left end of the command bar, a 760 px bar centred in the work area 16 px from its top
    (Switch.dc.html ``.hud``): the 44 px input row (a second ``hud.CommandBar`` in its HUD look: the chevron, "Ask
    Jarvis", the HUD key's keycaps - none while no key can work), Jarvis's caption line with the orb's state word, a
    hairline and "Bring Jarvis back"; under the bar the chips: "Briefing ready" (cyan), "N need your OK" (amber;
    ui.needs_ok_chip's words) and REC with a coral dot and the time (tabular figures: its width holds while the
    seconds tick); P2.4: "Timer \u00b7 ends 10:32 AM" (cyan, static) while a Jarvis timer runs. The caption wraps
    as the prototype's ``.bcap`` does, to at most ``CAPTION_LINES`` lines - the bar and the window grow with it, the
    chips move down - and only past that it is cut with an ellipsis, its whole text the tooltip
    (``WA_AlwaysShowToolTips``: the HUD is never the active window). ``place_on(screen)`` /
    ``place_in(area)``, ``area()``; ``set_caption(text)``; ``set_look(base, muted=, offline=)`` (the orb and the
    state word); ``set_briefing_ready(bool)``, ``set_pending(count)``, ``set_recording(elapsed, warning="")``,
    ``set_timer(text)`` (a chip whose words did not change is not repainted); ``chip_texts()``. P2.5: under the chips
    the instant row (``set_instant(items, dnd=, undo_all=)``, ``instant_texts()``; ``instant``, ``dnd_chip``,
    ``undo_all``): one cyan ``InstantChip`` per kind of change done at once - what it did and its NoFocus Undo link
    (``instantUndo(key)``) -, "Do Not Disturb - Turn on" while focus mode runs (``dndClicked``: Windows' own switch)
    and "Undo all" (``undoAllClicked``); it adds a row (or wraps) only while it shows, its chips fly with the others
    and have their glows in the layer; ``bar_rect()``,
    ``orb_center()``, ``occupied_rect()`` (global); ``glows()`` (the bar's and the chips' ``Glow``, global);
    ``cut_texts()`` (words cut or crowded: none at the sizes it is built for). Signals ``bringBackClicked()``,
    ``chipClicked(key)`` (``CHIP_BRIEFING``, ``CHIP_APPROVALS``, ``CHIP_REC``, ``CHIP_TIMER``), ``shapeChanged()`` (the
    window, the bar or a chip moved or changed size) and ``keyboardChanged(bool)``; the bar's own signals are on
    ``bar``. The bar's status (an answer, a question, a problem, what Jarvis is doing - as Home's thinking line, without
    its seconds) shows in the caption line without its technical readouts. The bar's keyboard (SPEC 8.3, P1.6): while
    idle the window keeps ``WindowDoesNotAcceptFocus``; ``take_keyboard()`` (the HUD key, through the app) or a click in
    the input remembers the window that has the keyboard, drops the flag on the NATIVE window (QWindow.setFlag; never
    QWidget.setWindowFlag, which recreates and hides it), activates it through the seam (never a synthetic key) and
    focuses the input - its outline lit; Enter, or Esc in an empty bar, gives the keyboard back (``give_back_keyboard``:
    the flag back, the remembered window activated again); Esc with text clears it and Esc while a request runs cancels
    it (CommandBar's own); the owner going to another window, or the HUD hiding, gives it back with nothing activated;
    ``holds_keyboard()``. Its
    paint is one cached pixmap (the panel, the hairlines, the orb's dark disc): an orb frame repaints 104 px of it.
    ``flight_pictures(dpr)``: the panel and what is in the bar as pictures of the whole window, and the chips' - the
    switch flies them in and out (alive.WindowFlight), also while the window is hidden.

``ResultCard``
    A result floating beside the thing it is about (DesktopB ``.glass``): the kicker with its dot, the title, a meta
    line, a row of buttons (NoFocus; a click emits ``buttonClicked(key)``; ``CardButton.right`` ones sit at the row's
    right end, as DesktopB puts the commit after "Not now") with a mono tag at its right ("2 OTHER MATCHES"), the
    items it offers (``CardRow``: a name over a meta line with a NoFocus link-style button - "Open this instead" -
    emitting the row's key; ``row_buttons()``) and a note - last, or with ``note_first`` right under the meta (what
    happened, before the actions: "Opened LING essay draft.docx in Word. Nothing else changed."). The card never
    takes the focus. ``set_content(CardContent)``; tones ``TONE_CYAN`` (Jarvis points at something), ``TONE_AMBER``
    (a decision waits), ``TONE_DONE``. ``place_beside(target, area=None, avoid=())`` puts it beside a global rect,
    never over it and clear of ``avoid`` (the HUD), kept inside the work area (ui._keep_on_screen's rule);
    ``cut_texts()``; ``glow()`` (its ``Glow``, global); ``shapeChanged()`` when it moves, changes size or tone.

``DesktopCard``
    P2.3: a NEEDS YOUR OK card of file steps beside the folder it is about (DesktopB's tidy card, 456 px): a
    ResultCard - its flags, its placing, its shadow in the layer - with one row per item: a tick box while it waits
    (``_TickBox``, NoFocus, a click toggles it: ``tickToggled(number, ticked)``), then each row's mark as the batch
    goes (done, on its way, not done, left unticked, can't go), its name and where it goes ("-> Documents > Uni >
    LING"), its flags in mono caps and a line of words under it; the note; the buttons (``DeskButton``: Not now, the
    commit - disabled while nothing is ticked -, Stop) and the stamp's Undo link with its note. Tones amber (a
    decision waits), cyan (Jarvis is at it), done (mint) and ``TONE_CORAL`` (failed or refused). ``set_desk(
    DeskContent)``, ``desk()``, ``ticks()``, ``buttons()``; ``HudOverlay.new_desk_card()``.

``PlanPanel``, ``PanelButtons``, ``TaskCard``
    A task's feed (the agent, part A3; made only while a task needs them, by agent_feed.TaskFeed). The panel under the
    bar on the left: click-through (``DECOR_FLAGS``: a window by job, never a partly click-through one), its header, the
    plan's rows and Jarvis's own activity line; ``set_panel(PanelContent)``, ``set_head(text)`` (the clock's tick
    repaints only the header), ``set_limits(width, max_height)``, at most about ``PANEL_MAX_ROWS`` rows and "+N more".
    ``PanelButtons``: the one small window over its header that takes clicks, Stop and Show, never the focus.
    ``TaskCard``: a ResultCard (its flags, its shadow in the layer, never the focus) with plain text that wraps anywhere
    and scrolls when it must, a task's outputs each with its two links, a note and its buttons;
    ``set_task(TaskContent)``. Its words are never read as HTML. ``HudOverlay.feed_panel()``, ``set_feed_shown(bool)``,
    ``place_feed(watch, card)``, ``new_task_card()``,
    ``adopt_card(card)``.

``DecorLayer``
    One per QScreen, sized to its geometry, also ``WindowTransparentForInput``: the outer shadows and glows under the
    interactive windows (``Glow``: Switch.dc.html's box-shadows of the bar, the chips and the cards - painted once per
    size into a cached sprite), the cyan or amber brackets (all four corners, a tag on the top edge), tethers (a
    dashed line with a dot at each end and a mono label) and the amber in-control edge glow, from global ``Glow`` /
    ``Bracket`` / ``Tether`` items (an item over two screens is drawn on each). Static: it repaints only when its
    items change - only where a shadow moved, when only shadows did - and has no timer; with nothing to draw it stays
    hidden.

``HudOverlay``
    The set: the HUD window, the cards and one DecorLayer per screen (screens coming and going follow; a work area
    that changes moves the HUD with it). ``show_on(screen)`` (``screen_for(window)``: the screen the Jarvis window is
    on) / ``hide()`` / ``is_shown()`` / ``hud_screen()``; ``new_card()``, ``show_card(card, target)`` (clear of the
    bar and the chips), ``remove_card(card)``, ``cards()``; ``set_decor(brackets, tethers, glow=False)``;
    ``layers()``; ``windows()``; ``set_neighbours(toast=, rec_pill=)`` and ``restack()``: bottom to top the
    DecorLayers, the RecPill, the cards, the Toast, the HUD window - nothing of Jarvis's is ever over the bar; while
    the HUD shows, the layer under it shows its shadows and glows (they follow the bar, the chips and the cards: a
    caption growing, a chip coming or going, a card placed) and the meetings RecPill (top centre, where the bar is)
    is held hidden (``RecPill.set_held``: REC is a chip here) and it comes back when the HUD hides;
    ``stack_order()``; ``shutdown()``. The switch (alive.WindowFlight; desktop_ui): ``prepare(screen)`` as it flies
    in (placed, still hidden, the pill held already), ``hide(release=False)`` as it flies out (the pill held until
    ``release()``: the window is back), ``reach()`` (the most it covers, with its shadows), ``flight_scene()`` (the
    pictures the flight shows: alive.HudScene) and ``hides_from_capture()``. ``create(config, native=None)`` is None
    while [desktop] is off: no HUD window then exists at all.

Capture, stacking and the bar's keyboard go through a small seam, ``HudNative`` (``exclude_from_capture(hwnd)``:
SetWindowDisplayAffinity WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE on every HUD window when [desktop] hide_from_capture is on, once per
native window; ``stack(hwnds)``: SetWindowPos HWND_TOPMOST with SWP_NOACTIVATE, bottom to top - never a raise or an
activation; ``foreground()``: GetForegroundWindow, none for Jarvis's own; ``activate(hwnd)`` and
``restore_foreground(hwnd)``: SetForegroundWindow attached to the foreground window's input, never a synthetic key -
only for the bar's keyboard, on the HUD key or the owner's click). ``default_native()`` is ``Win32Native`` only on the
real Windows platform outside the tests (the desktop test guard), else ``NoNative``, which makes no OS call; tests pass
their own fake. Logs carry statuses and error numbers only - never what is typed.
