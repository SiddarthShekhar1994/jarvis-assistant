Rules: nothing here touches the network, Qt, a file or the log; every function is pure, fast and
never raises (the interceptor and the navigation check call request_problem on the GUI thread for
every request of a page). request_problem checks names only; where a name resolves is checked by
the network gate (snapshot_gate: every connection of the private window goes through it, and it
connects only to the public address it checked). The gate connects over IPv4 only: a global IPv6
address may be this PC's own or a device's on its network (and a NAT64 one may carry a private IPv4
address), which a public-address test cannot tell from an internet host. Chromium never looks a
name up itself (RESOLVER_RULES). repr() of every object here names counts and sizes only, never a
URL.
