"""Jarvis's own voice: the utterance kinds, the interface the controller speaks through, the
queue policy and the speech worker.

An *utterance* is one thing Jarvis says on his own (a greeting, "your briefing
is ready to view", an acknowledgement, an Ask reply, the result of an approved
card, a notice); never the briefing itself, which has its own player.

The controller only ever calls the :class:`Voice` protocol. :class:`SilentVoice`
is the default: it never synthesizes or plays anything, so a controller that is
never started (every unit test) cannot make a sound. The real voice
(voice_ui.AssistantVoice: this module's :class:`SpeechLane` and :class:`SayWorker`
plus its own player; edge-tts with the Windows voice as fallback) is built only
by ``AppController.start()`` when ``[assistant] speak = true``.

* :class:`SpeechLane` is the pure queue policy: one utterance at a time, first
  in first out, at most ``QUEUE_CAP`` waiting (the oldest acknowledgement or
  greeting goes first, then the oldest of any kind), each dropped when it is
  too old to start (``STALE_AFTER_S``), a reply drops an acknowledgement that
  has not started, nothing starts while an undo countdown runs (``hold``) and
  nothing is queued while muted.
* :class:`SayWorker` is the daemon thread "tts-say" that owns its own speech
  synthesizer (made by a factory on that thread) and turns ``(seq, text)`` into
  audio. The synthesizer only ever sees the section key "say-<seq>" as a name;
  nothing here logs the text.

Qt-free; standard library only.
