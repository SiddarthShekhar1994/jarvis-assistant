"""Sending the replies and emails you approve, through the Gmail API (gmail.send only).

    OutgoingMail(...)            one message, exactly as it will be sent
    build_message(mail)          the RFC 5322 message (an email.message.EmailMessage), checked
    encode_raw(message)          base64url text for users.messages.send
    thread_link(address, id)     the sent message's thread in Gmail (the card's Open link)
    GmailSender(account)         one account's sending: ready(), sign_in(), send(mail) -> SentMail

What build_message refuses (GmailError, before anything goes anywhere):

- recipients: To and Cc together name 1 to MAX_RECIPIENTS addresses, at least one in To, each a
  plain address as actions.email_address writes it (no display name: a name never decides who
  an address is), no repeats, never the sender's own; there is never a Bcc header and never an
  attachment (one text/plain part).
- headers: a line break of any kind (CR, LF, U+0085, U+2028, U+2029, VT, FF), a control or
  invisible format character, an RFC 2047 encoded word ("=?...?=") in the subject (Python and
  mail apps decode it, so recipients would see other text than the card shows), a subject over
  250 characters (254 for a reply, whose "Re: " comes on top, as the briefing's subject= allows);
  In-Reply-To / References must be Message-IDs "<left@right>" of printable ASCII without spaces.
- the finished message is parsed back and must say exactly what was asked: the same From, To,
  Cc, Subject, In-Reply-To and References, no other header that names people (Bcc, Reply-To,
  Sender, Resent-*), one text/plain part whose text is the body.

A reply (``thread_id``) keeps a "Re: " subject, so Gmail files it in the thread, and carries
In-Reply-To / References when the line gave the Message-ID.

``GmailSender.send`` makes one users.messages.send call (num_retries=0) through
google_auth.single_send_http, so one approval sends at most one message: a 5xx answer, or no
answer after the request went out, is GmailUnknownOutcome (it may have been sent; never
retried). It never opens the browser and refuses unless the saved sign-in is the Google account
bound to the alias (GoogleAccount.identity_confirmed) and ``from_addr`` is that account's
address. Logs carry the alias ("work", "personal", else "other"), Gmail's message id, recipient
counts, HTTP statuses and Google's reason codes only; never addresses, subjects or text, and
error messages never quote an address.

A Gmail answer never signs the account out of its other features: the saved sign-in is shared
with the alias's calendar, so only a 401 (or a refresh Google rejects: invalid_grant) deletes it.
A 403 that says sending is not allowed, an administrator block or any other 403 turns sending off
for this alias until its next sign-in through Send (this run only); the calendar keeps working.

Qt-free; the Google libraries are imported lazily.
