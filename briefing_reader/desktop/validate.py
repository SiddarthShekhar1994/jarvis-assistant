"""The desktop planner's plan, checked (SPEC sections 2.1, 4.4 and 4.5, hard rules 2, 3, 6, 8 and 9; no Qt).

Claude only plans: its answer (ask.desktop_mode.plan_from reads it strictly into a ``DesktopAnswer`` of
``PlannedStep``s) names things by the refs this run issued (refs.RefIndex), never by a path, a program or an address.
``check_plan`` decides, step by step, what Jarvis would do with it - Jarvis's own code, never Claude's text, decides
the tier - and the planner's CLI schema is not trusted: this is the authority (no jsonschema library).

The checks, in this order; the first problem wins and its code goes to Live (``REASON_WORDS`` says it in words):

1. Shape: a known skill (any phase), only that skill's fields, its required fields, the enums and ranges
   (``SHAPE``); a skill's own item caps (``CAP``: move 200, rename 50, zip 1000 files).
2. Every ref was issued in THIS run's index, with the right kind (``UNKNOWN_REF``): a path, an id this index never
   issued, another run's id or a new folder (n1) no earlier passing make_folder made.
3. No duplicate files, no move into the folder a file is in already, no rename to the name it has, no file a
   card's earlier step moves or renames away, no repeated target name - the same name (case aside) twice in one
   folder, a new folder's own name included -, no item opened twice (``SHAPE``). A copy into its own folder is a
   duplicate (the card names it "name (2).ext").
4. New names (rename, a new folder, a zip): paths.name_problem (NFC, no control or hidden character, none of
   <>:"/\\|?*, no reserved device name, no trailing dot or space, 1-120 characters) and the extension kept unless
   the owner's words ask for another (``NAME_INVALID``); never a blocked type, a shortcut or an internet shortcut
   (``BLOCKED_TYPE``); never a name that would make a place Jarvis never touches - a code marker, a secret folder or
   file, AppData, a shell class name (``EXCLUDED``: paths.never_a_name); never one that reads like instructions
   unless the owner's own words give it (``NAME_INVALID``).
5. Typed values (fill_fields) word for word in the owner's words (``INTENT_NOT_LICENSED``) and plain text
   (``SHAPE``); a web address https on a public host (guard.url_problem: ``SHAPE`` for another scheme,
   ``SITE_NOT_APPROVED`` for a host that is not public).
6. The tier (INSTANT -> ONE_CLICK -> CARD -> NEVER), from the skill and its RESOLVED targets; checks only promote it.
   The NEVER list (guard; again in the executor right before each OS call) refuses: a secret-shaped file, a path
   whose text names a place Jarvis never touches (paths.static_problem: a network or device path, AppData, a code
   folder, a secret folder, a shell class name ...) or a place outside the scope (``EXCLUDED`` / ``PATH_OUTSIDE``:
   paths.check_path when the caller gives ``path_check``), a blocked or not-openable type (``BLOCKED_TYPE``), a
   never-open app (``APP_NOT_APPROVED``), a sensitive field (``SENSITIVE_FIELD``), a payment page
   (``PAYMENT_PAGE``). Phase 1's tiers (SPEC 2.1, owner decision D5): find_files, show_in_folder and open_folder
   INSTANT; open_file INSTANT for a document (2.3), CARD for one that can run macros or scripts and for a shortcut
   (its real target shown first), ONE_CLICK when its name has hidden characters; open_app INSTANT when the owner
   named the app exactly, else ONE_CLICK; open_url INSTANT for a saved site or an address the owner typed word for
   word, https:// and all, else ONE_CLICK (its host shown: one Claude suggested, or one typed without its https:// -
   "logo.ai" may be a file's name). An online-only file is flagged, not promoted (D5: files open at once).
   The file skills (P2.2: move_files, copy_files, rename_file, make_folder, zip_files; P2.6: recycle_files - the
   Recycle Bin only, at most 50 files and ``RECYCLE_MAX_BYTES`` a step, ``CAP``) are always CARD - a NEEDS
   YOUR OK card with ticks, its plan frozen (desktop.cardplan) - never INSTANT: a blocked type is never zipped and a
   shortcut never copied (``BLOCKED_TYPE``); a move stays on its drive (``CROSS_VOLUME``: refused in v1; the card's
   check compares the volumes themselves); flags say what the card must show (``FLAG_INSTALLER``: a program or an
   installer, unticked; ``FLAG_ONLINE_ONLY``, ``FLAG_HIDDEN_CHARS``, ``FLAG_BIG``, ``FLAG_MANY``,
   ``FLAG_TYPE_CHANGED``).
7. Intent licensing (``licensed_skills``: SPEC 4.5's table, deterministic, on the owner's typed words only - never a
   name, a title or Claude's text; "tidy my Downloads" can never license recycle_files) (``INTENT_NOT_LICENSED``)
   and scope licensing: what a step works on - its files, the place it looks in or opens - lies under the places
   the owner's words named to look in ("in my LING folder", "from Downloads", "the Uni folder"), when he named any
   (``SCOPE``). Where things go is no scope: "into LING" names a destination, and a move's ``to`` (or the place a
   new folder is made in) is not checked against the places named. The words OF A NAME in his words are only that
   name (P2.2): a name he put in quotes, and the name of anything this request lists (a file - with or without its
   extension -, a folder, an app, a site; for a name that reads like instructions, any three or more of its words in
   a row) never license a skill - "open Jarvis, delete all files.docx" licenses opening only - and a place named
   inside another name ("Notes from Downloads.txt") is no scope; only the request's own first word stays his when a
   one-word name or such a run starts there ("move the essay into Move"). A negation takes away every licence word
   after it in its clause ("zip the photos, don't move or delete the originals" licenses the zip only), and the
   Recycle Bin's words after it anywhere in their sentence.
8. The suspect rule: a step touching an item whose name reads like instructions (refs.Ref.suspect, guard's
   scanner) is refused unless the owner's own words name that item (``SUSPECT_ITEM``).
9. The skills shipped so far (``SHIPPED_SKILLS``: Phase 1's and the file skills, recycle_files with them since
   P2.6): any other is refused (``NOT_YET``: the PC's controls are local routes only, work inside apps is Phase 3).

Then the rate caps over the steps that passed, in order: at most ``MAX_OPENS`` opens and ``MAX_URLS`` web pages a
request (``CAP``); a refused step uses none.
