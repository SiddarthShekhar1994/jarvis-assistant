"""Jarvis's own search of this PC (SPEC sections 4.1, 5 and 13: index.py; no Qt).

It looks only inside the approved roots (paths.load_scope's Scope), and nothing it finds is listed before the path
check passes (paths.check_path: inside a root, no link anywhere, a fixed local drive, no excluded place, no code
folder, no secret file): excluded places, secret files and code folders are never listed, whatever the index or a
shortcut says. Every listed file and place carries its final path and its identity (backend.file_id, SPEC 5.3),
recorded as it is listed: desktop.executor compares it right before each OS call, so a target that changed between
the listing and the open is refused.

* The Windows Search index first: ``build_query`` writes one SQL query against SystemIndex - SCOPE'd to the roots
  (or to the places the owner's words named), the words matched in the file name, newest first, at most ``top``
  rows - with every quote doubled and LIKE's own wildcards taken literally (pure: the tests read its text);
  ``LocalSearch`` runs it through the backend within ``SEARCH_TIMEOUT_S``.
* When the index cannot answer (the service is off, the query fails) or finds nothing, a bounded walk of the same
  folders (``walk``): at most ``WALK.entries`` (50,000) entries, ``WALK.depth`` (8) levels below a folder,
  ``WALK.seconds`` (2) seconds; it never goes into a link (a junction, a symbolic link, an app execution alias or any
  reparse point that is not OneDrive's), a hidden folder, an excluded or secret folder name, a folder named like a
  code marker or one below a root that holds a code marker, a name ending in a shell class id, and never into an
  online-only (OneDrive) folder: nothing is fetched.
* The Recent items (``recent_files``): the targets of the newest shortcuts in Recent (read by the backend with
  IShellLink, never resolved); the shortcuts themselves are never listed, and each target passes the path check.
* The places (``folder_tree`` + ``pick_places``): the roots and their folders down to context.MAX_PLACE_DEPTH (3)
  levels, the ones the words name and the ones holding a listed file first, for <places>.

``query_words(text)`` are the words a request is searched by (casefolded, without the request's own verbs and
fillers). Logs carry counts and exception types only, never a word, a name or a path.
