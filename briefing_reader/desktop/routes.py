"""The desktop's local routes: simple requests handled on this PC with no planner run (SPEC section 2.2; no Qt).

A request typed on the HUD's bar that ask.routes calls a desktop request (ROUTE_DESKTOP) comes here first; only what
no route below takes goes to the planner (MODE_DESKTOP). Every pattern is a case-insensitive FULL match of the
whitespace-collapsed text, in the style of ask.routes (an optional leading "jarvis," / "please", an optional trailing
"." or "!"):

* Phase 1 (``route`` returns the step it stands for; the tier is INSTANT - the owner named the thing exactly - but
  for a bare web address):
  - "open|start|launch <app name>": an app of the context's Start-menu list whose name the words give exactly
    (case and spacing aside), never one on the never-open list (desktop.apps.never_item: by its name, id and exe);
  - "open|show (me) (my|the) <known folder> (folder)": Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Pictures, Music or Videos (the
    place is the context's when it lists that root);
  - "open <https address>" typed word for word, on a public host (guard.url_problem), or "open <saved site name>" (a
    context site's title exactly);
  - a bare web address with a common web ending ("open youtube.com"; https added, a public host) never opens at
    once (SPEC 2.1: only an https address typed word for word or a saved site does): a file of that very name in the
    folders allowed is found instead ("open logo.ai": the Illustrator file - its name never goes to the web), else
    the web page waits on a card for the owner's click, its host shown (ONE_CLICK, validate.FLAG_BARE_HOST);
  - "find|where is|where's <words>": when the local search (``search``: desktop.index on the desktop thread) finds
    at least one file with every word in its name.
* Phase 2, part 4 (the PC's controls, INSTANT, needing no candidates; the route's ``target`` is a desktop.pcctl
  PcAsk that desktop.pcctl carries out): "volume <n>|up|down|mute|unmute", "louder", "quieter", "mute", "unmute",
  "turn it|the volume up|down"; "pause|play|resume|next|skip|previous" (also "... the music" / "next song");
  "(set|start a) timer (for) <n> minutes ..." and "remind me in <n> minutes ..." (the label is the rest); "cancel|
  stop|end the timer(s)" (cancel_timer: the only way to one before P2.5's chips); "(take a) screenshot" and "...
  screenshot of the (active) window".
* Phase 2, part 5: "(start) focus (mode) for <n> minutes" (also "... for 2 hours", "... for an hour", "... for half
  an hour"): focus mode (desktop.pcctl.PcControl.focus; 1 to 240 minutes - a longer one is refused there, said).
* P2.R (p2r-3, D9's 7-day Undo): "undo", "undo that", "undo it", "undo the last change" / "... my last change" /
  "... the last one" (``undo_request``): the newest change within [desktop] undo_days comes back as its stamped card,
  rebuilt from its journal (desktop.service.recall_undo) - nothing is put back but by the owner's click on its Undo.

The app carries a Phase 1 route out on the desktop thread (desktop.service, desktop.executor: re-checked right before
its OS call) and says what came of it (desktop.executor.run_words); a PC control likewise (desktop.pcctl through
desktop.executor). ``route_words(found, address)`` is Jarvis's own sentence for a route as understood - what it
would do, and that nothing was opened (or changed) yet (the --desktop-dry-run's words) - or that it can't be done
yet (the HUD's caption for a later phase's request). Never a name: an app's, a site's or a file's name is other
people's text; only the known folders' own labels are said (and never a timer's label).

``desktop_request(text)`` is ask.routes' ROUTE_DESKTOP test (clear desktop verbs only): the shapes above, an opening
verb about something that is not Jarvis's own (mail, calendar, briefing, a screen), or a finding verb with a word that
says file, folder or place ("find my budget spreadsheet"; "find a time for lunch" stays an Ask).
