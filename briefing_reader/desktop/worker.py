"""The "desktop" thread (SPEC 6.4; no Qt): the desktop feature's searches and opens run here, off the GUI thread, one
at a time and in the order they were given - never on the calendar's _ActionWorker or the Ask thread.

``DesktopWorker.submit(fn, *args)`` queues a job and returns a concurrent.futures.Future for its result: the app's
side (desktop_ui) turns a Future's end into a Qt signal for the GUI thread; the Ask thread, which carries a planner's
plan out through the desktop (ask.desktop_mode.DesktopJob.carry_out), waits on its Future. The thread starts with the
first job (at start-up only for the journal's housekeeping, once the owner has turned the desktop on) and is a daemon,
like the "ask" thread; between jobs it waits on its queue (nothing runs at idle). ``stop()`` lets the job running
finish and cancels every job still queued; nothing is accepted after it.

Logs carry exception types only.
