"""The frozen card plan of a request's file steps (Jarvis on your desktop, P2.2; SPEC sections 3 step 7, 4.4, 5.2-5.4,
6.2 and 10.3; hard rules 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 12; no Qt).

The file skills (desktop.validate.ORGANISE_SKILLS: move_files, copy_files, rename_file, make_folder, zip_files and,
since P2.6, recycle_files) are always CARD: nothing of them happens until the owner's click on a NEEDS YOUR OK card
that shows every row, with ticks (P2.3). ``build_card`` makes that card's plan on the desktop thread, right before
the card shows (hard rule 8), from the checked plan's accepted file steps - their RESOLVED targets: the run's own
RefIndex entries with the 5.3 identity they were listed with, never a bare id resolved again against a newer index.
Each step becomes its rows (a move, a copy, a rename or a file to the Recycle Bin: one row per file; a new folder: one
row, keyed by its n id so later rows go into it; a zip: one row, into ``to`` or else next to its first file), and each
row is checked as things are now by
desktop.fileops.FileOps.check - the executor's own re-check: every source and the destination through the path check
(the roots, the NEVER list, secret names, code folders, network and removable drives, links), the same item
unchanged, a folder's bounded subtree walk, the name rules, the drive (a move stays on its volume in v1), the space -
with the card's earlier rows taken into account (a new folder not made yet; a name an earlier row takes). A row to
the Recycle Bin is checked by the bin too (desktop.recycle: a fixed drive, the bin on, room for it; an online-only
file would skip it), and one card bins at most 50 files and 2 GB (``fileops.R_RECYCLE_CAP`` past that).

* A name that is taken - on the disk or by an earlier row of the card - gets its free name ON THE PLAN ("Budget 2026
  (2).xlsx": fileops.free_name; hard rule 5: never chosen silently at run time), and the row says so
  (``FLAG_RENAMED``).
* A row that can't go keeps its reason (``code``: a fileops reason - "changed", "cross_volume", "online_only",
  "name_clash" ...): the card shows it as an information row, never ticked, never run.
* Each row's flags (SPEC 5.4; shown as text, never as colour alone): it uploads to OneDrive or leaves it (owner
  decision D3: allowed on the click, flagged), online-only, pinned, a folder whose listing is in the cloud, hidden
  characters in a name, renamed "(2)", a program or an installer (validate.FLAG_INSTALLER: unticked - installers stay
  where they are unless he ticks them), big (validate.BIG_BYTES or more), many (more than validate.MANY_FILES files in
  one row: a zip, a folder), a type changed on his word.

The plan is then FROZEN (``CardPlan``): the rows - what each does, to what (the items' paths and 5.3 identities),
where, under which name, with which flags and tick - with the run's id and when it was made and expires (``CARD_TTL``:
15 minutes), as canonical JSON (``canonical_json``: sorted keys, no spaces, ASCII escapes) and the sha256 of that
JSON. The card runs exactly that plan and nothing else (P2.3): before a click is carried out ``verify`` refuses a
plan that changed since it was frozen (``CARD_CHANGED``: its JSON no longer hashes to its sha256, its lifetime is
longer than CARD_TTL, or the card shown carried another sha256) or has expired (``CARD_EXPIRED``: by the wall clock
or the monotonic one; a wall clock set back never extends it); ``ops(ticked)`` then gives the rows that may go and
are ticked, in order, as fileops.FileOp rows, and fileops.FileOps.run checks each one again right before its OS call
(an item changed since: "Changed since - left as it is.").

The plan holds the owner's paths (memory only, like the journal): it is never logged and never sent to Claude; every
repr names kinds, codes and counts only.
