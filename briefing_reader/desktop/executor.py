"""Carrying out a desktop request's steps (SPEC sections 2.1, 3 step 6, 5 and 6.4; hard rules 3, 6, 8 and 14; no Qt).

The executor runs on the desktop worker's thread only (desktop.worker), one step at a time, in order. A step is a
planner's checked step (desktop.validate.CheckedStep: its tier and its targets as this run's RefIndex resolved them)
or a local route (desktop.routes.LocalRoute). Right before each OS call its target is re-resolved and re-checked
(hard rule 6; SPEC 5.2 and 5.3) - Jarvis's own entry, never a bare id:

* a file or a folder: the scope loaded afresh (paths.load_scope through ``scope()``), paths.check_path (inside a
  root, a fixed local drive, no link anywhere, no excluded place, code folder or secret file), the same final path as
  when it was listed and the same identity (backend.FileIdentity: volume, file id and - for a file - size and mtime);
  a known folder of a local route ("open Downloads") is found in the fresh scope by its key;
* the NEVER list again: a file opens at once only when its real type is a document (guard.open_kind), never a secret
  file; an app only when the Start menu, read afresh (``apps()``), still lists the same id with the same name and it
  is on no never-open list (desktop.apps); a web address only when it is https on a public host (guard.url_problem).

Then the tier decides (checks only ever promote it, hard rule 3): INSTANT steps make their one OS call (backend:
open_document, show_in_folder, open_folder, launch_app, open_url); ONE_CLICK and CARD steps make none - they are
held (WAITING) for the owner's click on their card (P1.9); find_files lists what the local search finds (FOUND; never
fed back to Claude). The file steps (P2.2: move, copy, rename, a new folder, a zip) are always CARD and change nothing
here: the plan's card is made and frozen first (desktop.cardplan.build_card: every row checked as things are now, a
taken name given its free "(2)" name on the plan, the rows' flags) - ``DesktopRun.card`` - and each step waits on it
(WAITING), or is refused with its rows' reason when none of them may go. An open_file that opens keeps the
request's other matches (``others``: owner decision D5's "Open this instead" rows, P1.9). The rate caps hold again
per request (MAX_OPENS opens, MAX_URLS web pages: SPEC 2.1), and a cancel stops before the next step: one OS call in
flight completes, no new one starts.

A click on a result card's button (P1.9, ``run_click``) goes the same way with the card's OWN item - the resolved
target and the identity it was shown with, never an id resolved again against a newer index (verified review note)
- re-checked as before any OS call; the click stands for at most ``granted`` (ONE_CLICK: a cyan card's Open, an "Open
this instead" row, Show in folder; CARD: an amber NEEDS YOUR OK card's Open). A step whose tier, from the item as it
is now, is above that is held again (WAITING) and nothing opens. A document that can run macros or scripts opens
only on a CARD click (backend.open_script_document); a shortcut never opens itself: its card's Open opens the
document it names (``via``: the shortcut is re-checked and its target read again first - it must still name that
document, unchanged).

P2.4: a local route to the PC's controls (volume, music, a timer, cancelling the timers, a screenshot: INSTANT) is
carried out by desktop.pcctl (``pc``: the desktop thread's PcControl; none: refused) - the cancel asked again right
before its OS call, the HUD's windows (``hud``) left out of a screenshot - and its result's ``target`` is the
pcctl.PcChange (what was before and after); its words are pcctl's own (change_words).

A target that changed since it was listed is left as it is (``CHANGED``: SPEC 5.3's "Changed since - left as it
is"); an OS call that fails is FAILED with its winerror. ``run_words`` is Jarvis's own sentence for a run (the HUD's
caption): kinds and counts - a known folder's own label at most - never a name, a path, a title or an address.
``describe`` is a step's line in Live (its skill, tier, status and code). Logs carry run ids, skills, statuses, codes,
counts, durations, exception types and winerrors only.
