"""The tidy card: what a NEEDS YOUR OK card of file steps shows and says, through its life (SPEC sections 5.4, 6.3
and 10.3; owner decisions D3 and D9; hard rules 4, 5, 7, 12, 14 and 17; Phase 2, part 3; no Qt).

A request's file steps (move, copy, rename, make a folder, zip) wait for the owner's click on ONE card that shows every
row of their frozen plan (desktop.cardplan.CardPlan, P2.2). ``make_card(plan, scope)`` runs on the desktop thread
right after the run (desktop.results.present) and gives the card's own copy of each row as it shows: the item's name
(hidden characters spelled out), where it goes ("Documents > Uni > LING", from the folder the owner allowed down; a
rename's new name), its flags as plain words (SPEC 5.4: shown as text, never as colour alone - "UPLOADS TO ONEDRIVE",
"LEAVES ONEDRIVE - REMOVED FROM YOUR OTHER DEVICES", "ONLINE-ONLY", "RENAMED - THAT NAME WAS TAKEN", "INSTALLER -
STAYS UNLESS YOU TICK IT", "BIG", "MANY FILES", "TYPE CHANGES" ...), whether it is ticked as the card shows (an
installer is not) and, for a row that can't go, why. The card keeps the plan itself (the click runs exactly it) and
the folder most of its items come from (the File Explorer window showing it gets the cyan bracket).

``TidyState`` is the card's life on the GUI thread (desktop_ui): WAITING (amber: a decision waits - the ticks, Not now
and "Move 5 files", "Nothing ticked" while nothing is), RUNNING ("MOVING 2 OF 5..." in cyan, each row's mark as it
ends, Stop), STOPPING (Stop or Esc pressed: it ends after the row on its way), DONE (the stamp "MOVED 5 FILES
<middle dot> 10:22 AM" in mint, or what was and wasn't done in coral, with Undo while there is something to put back),
REFUSED (nothing ran: the card expired or changed, the desktop can't act, or Jarvis on your desktop was turned off -
in plain words, coral), UNDOING ("PUTTING BACK...") and UNDONE (the stamp: "PUT BACK 5 OF 5" in mint, or the partial
stamp in coral - "PUT BACK 4 OF 5 <middle dot> 1 MOVED SINCE" - each row left as it is saying why: "Moved since - left
where it is."). ``tidy_text(state, hour24=)`` gives each state's copy (British spelling; the caption's "sir" is not
here) and its looks; ``said(state, address=)`` Jarvis's words for the caption once a batch or an Undo ends.

P2.6, the Recycle Bin: a card of recycle_files rows is the same card in its own words - "TO THE RECYCLE BIN <middle
dot> NEEDS YOUR OK", "Move these files to the Recycle Bin", each row going "to" the Recycle Bin, the note "You can get
them back from the Recycle Bin, or with Undo." (SPEC 10.3) and "Move 3 files to the Recycle Bin"; "BINNING 2 OF 3",
the stamp "BINNED 3 FILES <middle dot> 10:22 AM". Undo is offered for every kind now: moves and renames go back,
Jarvis's own copies and zips (unchanged) go to the Recycle Bin, what it binned comes back out of it, a new folder goes
when empty - and a copy or a zip that stopped part-way has its part-made copy binned by the same Undo
(``RowEnd.leftover``; the row says so).

The card's copy holds names and places: it is shown, never logged. Every repr here names states, kinds, counts and
codes only.
