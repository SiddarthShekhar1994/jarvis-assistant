"""The desktop backend: every OS call the desktop feature makes goes through one (SPEC sections 5, 13 and 15; no Qt).

``DesktopBackend`` is what a backend offers. The app uses ``Win32Backend`` (ctypes and pywin32: the Windows shell and
the Windows Search index); tests use tests/desktop_fakes.FakeDesktopBackend, which records every call and works only
inside a temporary folder. While the test guard is on (``TEST_GUARD_ENV`` = "1", set by the tests package before any
test runs) constructing the real backend raises ``RealBackendInTests`` - and so does EVERY method of it that touches
the OS (verified review note, 2026-10-21): a real backend made before the guard went on still reaches nothing. Every
public method of ``Win32Backend`` is marked by ``_real`` (its ``reaches_os`` attribute), which checks the guard first.

The methods:

* Facts for the path check (SPEC 5.2 and 5.3): ``known_folder`` (SHGetKnownFolderPath: follows the OneDrive
  redirection), ``final_path`` (realpath(strict=True), then GetFinalPathNameByHandleW on an opened handle),
  ``file_info`` (lstat: a link is not followed), ``exists``, ``drive_type`` (GetDriveTypeW) and ``file_id`` (the
  file's identity: the volume serial and the 128-bit file id CPython reads from FILE_ID_INFO, its size and mtime).
* Looking (P1.8: desktop.index and desktop.apps decide what may be listed): ``list_folder`` (one folder's entries
  from its directory listing - nothing in it is opened, a link is never followed), ``search_index`` (one Windows
  Search SQL query that desktop.index built and scoped to the roots, with a timeout and a row cap),
  ``recent_items`` (the targets the newest Recent items' shortcuts name, read with IShellLink and never resolved)
  and ``start_menu_apps`` (the Start menu's apps: shell:AppsFolder's names and ids).
* Opening (P1.8; SPEC 2.1, 2.3 and 5.5): ``open_document`` (ShellExecuteExW "open", for a document type of SPEC 2.3
  only), ``show_in_folder`` and ``open_folder`` (SHOpenFolderAndSelectItems: never a command line), ``launch_app``
  (an AppsFolder item, with no arguments) and ``open_url`` (an https address on a public host only). P1.9 adds
  ``open_script_document`` (the same open, for a document that can run macros or scripts only - desktop.executor asks
  for it only after the owner's click on that file's NEEDS YOUR OK card). desktop.executor re-checks every target just
  before; each open is guarded here once more (hard rule 6) by the NEVER list's own rules: a path that is not a plain
  local path on a fixed drive, a type that is not of that open's kind, an app id or an address that is not of its
  shape raises ValueError and nothing is asked of Windows. No open passes arguments, asks for another verb than
  "open" or turns the zone checks off.
* For the result cards (P1.9): ``app_for`` - the app Windows opens a file type or the https protocol with (its
  friendly name and its exe, from the associations only: AssocQueryStringW; nothing is opened or read) - and
  ``link_target`` - the path a shortcut names (IShellLink Load and GetPath, never Resolve: nothing is searched or
  started), so its card can show the real target before anything opens (SPEC 2.4).
* Organising files (P2.1; SPEC 6.2 - desktop.fileops checks every row, source and destination, right before):
  ``move_item`` (MoveFileExW without MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING or MOVEFILE_COPY_ALLOWED: never over anything, never
  to another volume), ``copy_file`` (CopyFileExW fail-if-exists, with a cancel callback), ``make_folder``
  (CreateDirectoryW), ``remove_folder`` (RemoveDirectoryW: an empty folder Jarvis made, for Undo), ``write_zip`` (a
  new zip under a temporary name, removed by Windows unless it is finished), ``zone_identifier`` (a file's mark of the
  web, copied onto a zip), ``content_hash`` (sha256: a copy's or a zip's, for Undo) and ``free_space``. Each is
  guarded once more (a plain path on a fixed drive, never a secret file, never a blocked type zipped); the raw calls
  live in desktop.fileops. P2.4 adds ``save_png`` (a screenshot's new file: a .png holding a PNG only, CREATE_NEW -
  never over anything; desktop.pcctl names it).

No method is ever named for something on the NEVER list (guard.NEVER_CAPABILITIES): there is no delete, no close, no
shell command, no send. Logs carry folder keys, counts and exception types (with a winerror) only, never a path, a
name, a title or an address.
