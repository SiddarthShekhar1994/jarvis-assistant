"""Jarvis on your desktop: the core, without Qt (SPEC "Jarvis on the desktop", sections 2, 4, 5, 6.4, 13 and 15).

Off unless [desktop] enabled (or JARVIS_DESKTOP_ENABLED) is true. Built so far (Phase 1, parts 2, 7 and 8):

* ``backend``: ``DesktopBackend``, through which every OS call goes, and ``Win32Backend``, the real one (the path
  check's facts, the search index, folder listings, the Recent items, the Start menu, and the opens - each guarded
  once more). While the tests run (the test guard) constructing the real backend raises, and so does every one of its
  methods.
* ``paths``: the roots Jarvis may look in, the excluded places and the path check made before a card shows and
  again before each OS call.
* ``guard``: the NEVER list (section 2.4) as constants and checks, and the suspect-name scanner.
* ``refs``: the per-run ref index (f12, d3, a1 ...) the planner sees instead of paths.
* ``context``: what the planner may be told (names only) and ``build_context`` within SPEC 4.1's caps.
* ``routes``: the local routes handled on this PC with no planner run; ``validate``: the planner's plan checked.
* ``index``: Jarvis's own search of this PC (the Windows Search index, else a bounded walk; the Recent items; the
  places), only ever inside the roots; ``apps``: the Start menu's apps minus the never-open ones.
* ``executor``: a request's steps carried out, each target re-checked right before its one OS call; ``service``: the
  desktop thread's work (a request resolved, a plan carried out); ``worker``: the "desktop" thread itself.
* Phase 2, part 1: ``journal`` (the write-ahead journal of what was done to the owner's files: start-up recovery,
  purge) and ``fileops`` (move, rename, copy, make a folder, zip - every row re-checked, source and destination, right
  before its OS call - and Undo, item by item in reverse order).
* Phase 2, part 4: ``pcctl`` - the PC's controls (volume and mute through Core Audio, music through the player's
  controls or the media keys, Jarvis's own timers, screenshots with the HUD left out), INSTANT local routes behind
  their own seam (``Win32Pc``: every method raises while the tests run), each change kept for Undo all.

Nothing in this package imports Qt, starts a process or a shell (tests/test_desktop_guard.py greps for it), or logs
a path, a name, a title or a typed value.
