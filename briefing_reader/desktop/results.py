"""What a desktop request's results show on the desktop (SPEC sections 2.1, 3 step 6, 5.3, 5.4, 8.1 and 10.3; owner
decision D5; hard rules 4, 9 and 14; Phase 1, part 9; no Qt).

``present(run, ...)`` runs on the desktop thread right after a run (desktop.service: a local route, a planner's plan
or a card's click) and turns its results into ``Card`` s - the result cards the HUD floats beside what they are about
(desktop_results, hud_overlay.ResultCard):

* ``OPENED``: what opened (owner decision D5: a file's best match is ALREADY OPEN): the file, folder, app or web page,
  where it is and when it changed, the app it opened in (backend.app_for: the type's association - its name for the
  card and its exe to find its window by) and, for a file, the other matches as "Open this instead" rows;
* ``WAITING``: a step held for the owner's click (hard rule 4): ONE_CLICK - an app he did not name exactly, a web
  page he did not type or typed without its https:// (its host shown), a file whose name has hidden characters
  (spelled out as <U+202E>) - or CARD, amber - a document that can run macros or scripts, a shortcut (its real target
  shown first: backend.link_target, read and never resolved; it opens only when that is a document in his folders);
* ``FOUND``: what a find found, as rows to open (or show in their folder: a type Jarvis never opens).

Every card keeps its OWN items - the resolved target and the identity it passed its check with (verified review
note: never an id resolved again against a newer index) - and a row is offered only after its own re-check
(executor.recheck: still where it was, unchanged, inside the folders allowed, never secret-shaped), never when its
name reads like instructions (guard.suspect_text: treated as data, not offered) and only when it is a type Jarvis
may open or show. A card's click goes back through executor.run_click with that item.

``card_text(card, hour24=)`` is each card's copy (British spelling; no "sir" - that is the caption's): the kicker
with its stamp ("OPENED IN WORD <middle dot> 10:21 AM"), the title, the meta line ("Documents > Uni > LING <middle dot> edited
yesterday, 9:14 PM"), the note ("Opened LING essay draft.docx in Word. Nothing else changed."), the buttons and the
rows. Names, places and addresses go on the cards only: nothing here is logged but kinds and counts, and every repr
names kinds and counts only.
