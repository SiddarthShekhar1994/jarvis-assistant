"""The desktop journal: what Jarvis did to the owner's files, saved before and after each OS call (SPEC section 6.1;
hard rules 12 and 14; no Qt).

One JSON Lines file per run, ``<run_id>.jsonl``, in the journal folder. The app's folder is
%LOCALAPPDATA%\\briefing-reader\\desktop\\journal (``default_folder()``: on this PC, never OneDrive); the folder is
always a parameter, and while the tests run ``default_folder()`` refuses (backend.RealBackendInTests), so a test can
only ever pass its own temporary folder.

Each line is one ``Record``: an item of the run - ``seq`` is its row on the card - going into a state. The lines are
appended, never rewritten; an item's state is its latest line (``items``). The states:

* ``planned`` - on the card, not started; ``doing`` - its one OS call is in flight; ``done``, ``failed`` (with a
  reason code) or ``skipped`` (never tried: a check refused it, or the owner stopped the run first);
* putting it back (Undo, the owner's click): a ``doing`` line with ``undo`` set, then ``undone`` or ``undo_refused``
  (with the reason the card shows; an item refused once may be tried again).

Write-ahead (hard rule 12): fileops appends "doing" - written, flushed and FlushFileBuffers'd (os.fsync) - before the
OS call, and does nothing when it cannot be saved (``JournalError``); then "done" or "failed". What a record's identity
fields (``volume_serial``, ``file_id``, ``size``, ``mtime_ns``, ``attrs``) describe: the item as it was found before
the call on a "planned"/"doing" line (the source), and the result on a "done" line (a moved file keeps its id; a copy,
a zip or a new folder is a new item, and a copy's or a zip's ``sha256`` is its content's).

Start-up recovery (``recover``): an item left "doing" by a crash is corrected by looking - never redone. A move or a
rename is "done" when its file id is at ``dst``, "failed" (interrupted) when it is still at ``src``, "failed" (lost)
when it is at neither; a file copy is "done" only when its output's content is its (unchanged) source's, else
"failed" (partial, or interrupted); a zip or a folder copy - written under a temporary name, then its file id and
hash saved, then renamed into place - is "done" only when that file id is at ``dst``, "failed" (partial) when it is
still under the temporary name or only part of it was made, else "failed"; a new folder is "done" when it is there;
an item on its way to the Recycle Bin (P2.6) is "failed" (interrupted) while its file id is still at ``src``, else
"done" - Undo then looks for it in the bin and says plainly when the bin doesn't have it.
An Undo left "doing" becomes "undone" when the item is back (or Jarvis's own output is gone), else "undo_refused"
again. A path that is no plain path on a fixed drive now is never touched: that item is "failed" (unchecked).

``purge`` removes the runs older than ``PURGE_DAYS`` (30; at start-up and daily); Undo is offered for [desktop]
undo_days (1-30) only (fileops.Undoer). The journal holds paths - Undo needs them - so it is the owner's own local
file: it is never logged and never sent to Claude. Logs carry run ids, counts, states, reason codes and exception
types only.
