"""The per-run ref index: the ids the planner sees instead of paths, programs and addresses (SPEC hard rule 8; no Qt).

Claude never writes a path, an exe, a command line or a host. Every file, folder, app, site, window, field and cell
the planner may name is an id that Jarvis issued in THIS run's context: f12 (a file), d3 (a place), a1 (an app), s2
(a site), w1 (a window), e7 (a field), c4 (a cell); n1 is a new folder the plan itself makes (make_folder's id).
Each id resolves to the entry Jarvis's own index gave it (``Ref.target``: a path, an app entry ...), and only in the
index that issued it: a typed path, an id this index never issued or an id with a leading zero is unknown
(validate.py: unknown_ref). Ids carry no run identity: every run starts a new index that numbers each kind from 1
again, so "f1" in a newer run's index is a different file. A card (and its frozen plan) therefore keeps its own
RefIndex, or the resolved targets plus their identity (SPEC 5.3), and never re-resolves bare ids against a newer
run's index. Numbers follow the schema's patterns (f up to 4 digits; d, a, e, c up to 3; s, w, n up to 2): once a
kind's numbers run out it issues no more (``issue`` returns "").

``issue(kind, target, label)`` gives the same id to the same target twice. The label is what the planner sees of
it ("name.ext", "Microsoft Word"); for the kinds other people name (files, places, windows, fields, cells) the
suspect scanner (guard.suspect_text) reads it, and a label that reads like an order marks the ref ``suspect``.
Nothing here is logged but ``counts()``; ``repr`` never shows a target or a label.
