"""A global Esc while a desktop batch acts (SPEC sections 9 and 10.1; hard rules 10, 12 and 13; Phase 2, part 3; no
Qt).

While a NEEDS YOUR OK card's rows are carried out - or put back by its Undo - Esc anywhere stops the batch at the next
row: the owner may be looking at another window. ``held(keys, on_stop)`` arms Esc as a global hot key right as the
batch starts acting (its plan's check passed) and releases it as the batch ends (in a finally): never at idle, never
while a plan is made, never otherwise. ``on_stop`` sets the batch's stop flag (a threading.Event: the batch, on the
desktop thread, asks it before each row and during a copy or a zip).

``Win32StopKeys`` is the real seam: RegisterHotKey(NULL, id, MOD_NOREPEAT, VK_ESCAPE) on a thread of its own with its
own message queue - WM_HOTKEY there calls ``on_stop`` - and ``disarm()`` posts WM_QUIT to that thread, which
unregisters the key (on the thread that registered it) before it ends. While Esc is held other programs don't get it,
for the seconds a batch takes. When another program holds Esc already, RegisterHotKey fails and the batch goes on with
the card's Stop only (logged as a status). It never presses, sends or synthesises a key and never activates a window.

The real seam refuses to be made - and each of its methods refuses - while the desktop test guard is on
(backend.RealBackendInTests); ``default_stopkeys()`` then gives ``NoStopKeys``, which registers nothing (as it does
off Windows). Tests pass tests.desktop_fakes.FakeStopKeys. Logs carry statuses and winerrors only.
