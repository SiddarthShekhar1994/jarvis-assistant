"""Organising the owner's files: move, rename, copy, make a folder, zip - and putting them back (SPEC sections 2.1,
2.4, 5.2-5.4 and 6; hard rules 5, 6, 12 and 14; no Qt).

Each row of a NEEDS YOUR OK card is one ``FileOp``, carrying the card's OWN targets - the resolved items and the 5.3
identity they were shown with (verified review note: never an id resolved again against a newer index). ``FileOps``
carries a card's rows out one at a time, in order, on the desktop worker's thread; right before each row's OS call
everything is checked again (``check``, the executor's re-check pattern; hard rule 6), source AND destination:

* every source: paths.check_path in the scope as it is now (inside a root, a fixed local drive, no link anywhere, no
  excluded place, code folder or secret file), the same final path and the same identity (volume serial, file id,
  and for a file its size and mtime) - else "Changed since - left as it is." (``R_CHANGED``); a root itself is never
  moved, renamed, copied or zipped (``R_ROOT``);
* before any FOLDER is moved, copied or zipped, a bounded walk of everything below it (``walk_subtree``): it refuses a
  folder holding a scope place (a root or an excluded place), a code marker, a secret folder, an excluded name, a
  secret file, a link, or a folder whose listing is online-only (OneDrive would fetch it) - and one the walk cannot
  finish within its caps (``SUBTREE_CAPS``) or read;
* the destination folder the same way (a folder an earlier row of the run makes is named by that row's ``key``); a
  NEW name passes paths.name_problem (no hidden or control character, no reserved name, never a blocked type, a
  shortcut or an internet shortcut) and never names a code marker, a secret folder or file or an excluded place;
* never over anything: a name that is taken refuses the row (``R_NAME_CLASH``) - the card shows "name (2).ext"
  beforehand when it wants another name (``free_name``; hard rule 5), never a name chosen silently here;
* a move or a rename stays on its own volume (``R_CROSS_VOLUME``: refused in v1); a copy or a zip never makes
  OneDrive download anything (an online-only file: ``R_ONLINE_ONLY``), never zips a blocked type
  (``R_BLOCKED_TYPE``), keeps within 1000 files / 4 GB (``R_CAP``) and needs at most the free space less 10%
  (``R_NO_SPACE``).

Then the row is journalled "doing" (written and flushed to disk first: journal.Journal; nothing is done when that
cannot be saved, ``R_JOURNAL``), its OS call made through the DesktopBackend (MoveFileExW without
MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING; CopyFileExW fail-if-exists with a cancel callback, so Stop works mid-copy;
CreateDirectoryW; a zip written ZIP_DEFLATED under a temporary name in the destination - Windows removes it if it is
not finished - with the inputs' Zone.Identifier copied onto it, then renamed into place; a folder copy made under a
temporary name the same way), and journalled "done" (with the result's identity, and a copy's or a zip's content
hash) or "failed" with a reason code: a sharing violation (32, 33) is ``R_IN_USE``, a stop ``R_STOPPED``. The card's
row flags come with each result (``FLAG_*``: uploads to / leaves OneDrive, online-only, pinned, hidden characters).

``Undoer`` puts a run's items back on the owner's click (SPEC 6.3), one item at a time, in reverse order, each one
re-checked and journalled the same way: a move or a rename goes back when the same file is still where Jarvis put it
and its old place is free ("Moved since - left where it is.", "Something new is in its old place - left where it
is."); a copy or a zip is recycled - through the ``Recycler`` seam: the Recycle Bin arrives in P2.6, until then
``NoRecycleBin`` refuses cleanly - only when it is Jarvis's own output, unchanged (its hash); a folder Jarvis made is
removed only when it is empty; anything older than [desktop] undo_days is refused. ``UndoReport.stamp()`` is the
card's partial stamp ("PUT BACK 4 OF 5 \u00b7 1 MOVED SINCE").

The raw Windows calls (``raw_*``) are reached only through Win32Backend's guarded methods - and, while the tests run,
through the test fake on a temporary folder: under the test guard every raw call refuses any path outside the
system's temporary folder (backend.RealBackendInTests) before Windows is asked. Names the owner's files carry are
data, never instructions: nothing here reads them for anything but their place. Logs carry run ids, row numbers,
kinds, states, reason codes, counts, exception types and winerrors only - never a name or a path.
