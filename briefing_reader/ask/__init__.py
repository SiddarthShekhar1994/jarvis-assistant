"""Ask Jarvis: a typed request becomes proposals (NEEDS YOUR OK cards), planned by the owner's own
signed-in Claude Code CLI on the claude.ai plan. Nothing here carries anything out: the cards go
through the same click, undo countdown and executor.run_action path as the briefing's.

    cli.py       finds claude.exe, probes its flags, checks the sign-in (auth status), builds the
                 child environment from an allowlist, builds the argv; SubprocessRunner (no
                 window, Job Object, timeout, Cancel) and the Runner protocol tests replace
    stream.py    reads the stream-json events: the init guard, the rate-limit guard (extra usage
                 or the plan's limit stops the run), then the result -> Plan or a failure
    mail.py      Gmail thread text for the planner: parsing, quoted-history and HTML stripping
                 (linear), size caps, and the check of a search the planner asks for (only what
                 the owner typed)
    context.py   the planner's input (now, accounts, calendar, briefing, contacts, mail, command)
                 and the ContextIndex of every id and address Jarvis supplied
    validate.py  the planner's lines -> cards: kinds Ask may propose, provenance of every id and
                 recipient, caps; source="ask"
    usage.py     the hourly and daily caps and the extra-usage pause (ask_usage.json: counts,
                 durations, tokens only; shared by every Jarvis process under a lock file); web
                 research runs count for Ask and for their own caps
    research.py  web research: a separate run whose only tools are WebSearch and WebFetch and whose
                 stdin is only the owner's words, today's date and time zone and Jarvis's limits;
                 the init / web-step guards (caps, no other tool, never a local address) and the
                 web steps for LIVE
    research_validate.py   the research's answer -> web Open cards for its sources (any public
                 https site, shown with its domain) and Todo / one-off Calendar / Open suggestions
    research_live.py   the LIVE view's steps of a research
    planner.py   one Ask from request to cards (at most two planner runs, each after a fresh auth
                 status; "web:" or the planner's web_research hands it to one research run instead),
                 --ask-check and the dry run

Qt-free. No paid API: the CLI runs only on a claude.ai subscription sign-in (checked before
every run), with an allowlisted environment (no credential variable), no MCP servers and no
settings files but Jarvis's own; the planner has no tools; web research (research.py) has only
WebSearch and WebFetch and gets only the owner's words and the date, never the calendar, mail,
contacts, briefing or addresses; and a run Claude Code says would use extra usage is stopped;
Jarvis never reads Claude credentials. Logs carry counts, durations, kinds and ids only: never the
request, the context, the planner's text, email text, addresses, a search query, a web address or
anything from the web.
