                                    read as a WebCall (with its WebResult), the caps (the 5th search
                                    or page read stops the run), no other tool, never a local or

                                    RunResult.answer is the ResearchAnswer, RunResult.web the WebLog

The isolation rule: the research run gets only build_research_prompt's text on stdin (the owner's
words, today's date and time zone and Jarvis's own limits), a command line with no tool but the two
web tools (cli.build_research_argv), the allowlisted environment (cli.clean_env) and an empty work
folder of its own. Its answer only becomes cards (research_validate) that wait for the owner's
click like every other card.

Pure except run_research (which starts the CLI through the given runner). Nothing here logs a
question, a query, a URL, a domain, page text or the answer: the reprs of WebCall, WebResult,
WebLog and ResearchAnswer name kinds, ids and counts only.
