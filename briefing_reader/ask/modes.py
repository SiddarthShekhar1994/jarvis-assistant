"""The productivity bundle's planner modes: what each run is told and from what (spec 5.2, 7).

A mode is a planner run of its own (ClaudeEngine.run_mode): its own system prompt and schema, no
tools, no mail search, no web research, no second run: the day plan, the meeting brief and the
drafted reply or nudge of a follow-up; also a meeting's summary (MODE_MEETING) and a desktop request
(MODE_DESKTOP, ask.desktop_mode: one JSON plan of refs, no card lines):

    ModeRequest(mode, origin, typed=, part=, ...)   what started it (typed, an offer, a click); the
                                     owner's own words only in ``typed``
    ModeInputs(todos, deadlines, ...)  the GUI thread's snapshot handed to the job (to-dos with the
                                     Todo card ids they come from, the merged deadlines, the owner's
                                     own addresses)
    todo_facts(cards, planned=)      the pending Todo cards as TodoFacts (the card id stays in memory;
                                     the run only ever sees Jarvis's row ids t1, t2, ...)
    command_text(request)            the fixed <command> (titles, names and addresses never enter
                                     it; only the owner's typed words may follow, "The owner's words: ")
    build_plan_prompt(...)           PlanPrompt: the plan's stdin (7.2), the ContextIndex of what it
                                     showed and the <todos> row ids it showed (a block serves only those)
    index_of(ctx, shown)             context's index of an AskContext and the events shown
    build_prep_prompt(...)           a meeting brief's stdin (7.3): the meeting's account, the meeting,
                                     <people> (ask.prep.people_block), the threads Jarvis read with its
                                     guests, the notes, the fixed command (never the owner's words)
    build_nudge_prompt(...)          a drafted reply or nudge's stdin (7.4): the thread's account,
                                     <followup> (kind, who wrote last, days, account, thread), the one
                                     thread read, the notes, the fixed command for its kind and only the
                                     owner's own words from "Tell Jarvis what to say"
    nudge_guard(thread, target, own) "" or why no draft is made: the owner replied since (waiting),
                                     they answered since (owed), or anything else changed (R47)
    owed_target(thread, alias, own)  a brief's "owes you an answer" (R32): the thread as a ThreadTarget
                                     when the owner wrote last (followups' deciding-message rules)
    NudgeCheck(target, thread, notes, owner_words=, own=)   validate.to_cards' ``extra`` for the
                                     draft (8.3): that thread, that message, only its people, never a note

Every data field goes through context.data(), a plan's stdin is at most MAX_PLAN_STDIN characters
(a brief's at most an Ask's, context.MAX_STDIN_CHARS) and <command> is last and once. Pure;
nothing here is logged (the reprs name kinds only).
