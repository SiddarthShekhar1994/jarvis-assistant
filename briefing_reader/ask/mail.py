"""Gmail thread text for Ask Jarvis: the searches the planner may ask for, and what it may read.

    check_query(query, grounding)  the planner's Gmail search, normalized, or QueryRefused: plain
                                   words, quoted phrases and a short list of operators only; never
                                   spam / trash, never passwords, codes, sign-in or security mail,
                                   banking or account recovery, never an account-security sender,
                                   never a URL; something of 3+ characters must narrow it. With
                                   ``grounding`` (the planner always passes it) every word, phrase
                                   and from: / to: / cc: value must come from the owner: the words
                                   typed in the command, an address typed there, or a person Jarvis
                                   supplied from the calendar or the briefing whose name the command
                                   names. Email text never grounds a search.
    thread_from_api(data, account) a users.threads.get answer (format=full) -> MailThread
    message_text(payload)          one message's readable text: text/plain (else the HTML made
                                   plain), without quoted history, signatures, attachments or
                                   invisible characters
    trim_threads(threads)          at most MAX_THREADS threads and MAX_MAIL_CHARS characters: the
                                   newest message of each thread in full (up to NEWEST_CHARS), older
                                   ones cut to OLDER_CHARS, the oldest left out first
    briefing_threads(command, ...) the briefing's Reply cards a request clearly names (their threads
                                   are read without a search)

Everything here is pure and works on data already fetched (gmail.GmailReader does the read-only
API calls). The text lives in memory for one Ask only: nothing here logs or saves it.
