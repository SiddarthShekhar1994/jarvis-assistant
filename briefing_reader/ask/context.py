"""The planner's input for one Ask, and the index of every id and address Jarvis supplied.

    build_prompt(ctx, redact_mail=False) -> (text, ContextIndex)
    thread_text(thread)   the exact <mail> lines of one thread (what the LIVE view shows of it)

The text has these blocks, in order: <now>, <owner> (one line: the word Jarvis addresses the owner
with, "sir" by default, from [assistant] address; empty for none), <accounts>, <calendar>,
<briefing>, <contacts>, <mail> (only when Jarvis read mail for this Ask), <memory> (only when the
owner keeps notes: the productivity bundle's memory.json, at most 8 KB - every note while they all
fit, else the ones closest to the command first, then the newest: memory.pick_notes),
<conversation> (only when something was said before this request: the owner's earlier requests
and Jarvis's words as the window showed them, oldest first, at most 12 exchanges and 8 KB of rows,
each turn at most 1,000 characters, the oldest exchanges left out first, with a closing line that
it is for context only; conversation.Turn) and <command>, always last (the owner's words, at most
COMMAND_CAP characters). Every data field is
sanitized: "<" and ">" become "\u2039" and "\u203a" (so no data can open or close a block), "|"
becomes "/" (so no field can split a row), control and invisible format characters are removed,
line breaks too except inside quoted email text (indented, one line per line), and lengths are
capped: titles 120 characters, names 60, at most 10 guests an event ("+N more"), at most 200 events
(the next 7 days first), the briefing 8 KB, everything but the mail 40 KB, the mail's text 16 KB
(ask.mail.trim_threads) and its whole block, headers included, 24 KB (older messages, then whole
threads, left out until it fits): the stdin is never over MAX_STDIN_CHARS. Within the 40 KB the
calendar rows give way first; when the owner's words leave no room even without them, the
conversation's oldest exchanges, then the oldest notes given. An email header shows
at most 10 people ("+N more"; ask.mail.MAX_PEOPLE). Events carry no description, location or
meeting link (gcal.EventBrief has none).

ContextIndex is what validate.py checks the planner's lines against: the events (account,
calendar, id) with whether you organize them, the threads a Reply may answer (from the briefing's
Reply lines and the mail Jarvis read) with their Message-IDs and Gmail ids, and every address with
where it came from ("guest", "briefing", "mail", "memory" (a note), "conversation" (said earlier)
or "owner": typed in the command; a note's or the conversation's address is known but never typed,
so a recipient seen only there stays NEW until ticked, and it never grounds a mail search; nothing
in <conversation> is an event, thread or message id). Only what the
text shows is in it: the events that fit, their first 10 guests, the briefing cards that fit, the
people each email header shows. ContextIndex.search_grounding() is what a mail search may name
(ask.mail.check_query).

Pure: nothing here talks to Google or Claude, and nothing is logged.
