"""One Ask from request to cards (at most two planner runs), and the checks that need no model request.

    ClaudeEngine(ask_config, data_dir, runner, environ)
        readiness(refresh=False)   Readiness: claude.exe found, its flags probed, a claude.ai
                                   subscription sign-in, an empty work folder. No model request;
                                   cached until a run fails
        run(prompt, allow_search, cancel, progress, capture)   RunResult of one planner run
                                   (stream.run_planner; progress / capture feed the LIVE view)
    ResearchEngine(research_config, base)   web research on the same Claude Code: readiness (also
                                   --allowedTools and an empty research folder) and research runs
                                   (ask.research.run_research)
    GoogleSources(config, calendars, senders, readers)   what Jarvis may tell the planner about each
                                   account (no sign-in ever; reads only)
    AskPlanner(config, engine, sources, usage, research=)
        plan(command, briefing, page_ids, cancel, on_stage, live) -> AskOutcome (``live``: the Ask's
                                   LIVE view task: every check, read, run and line, as it happens)
        dry_run(command, briefing) -> DryRun (the exact stdin text, email text as counts)
        research_dry_run(question) -> DryRun (a "web:" request's research stdin and command line)
    briefing_context(...)          the briefing as Ask may see it (pending cards, sections, deadlines)

Web research: a request that starts with "web:" (or "research:") reads nothing from the accounts
and runs one research run with the owner's words; planner run 1 may instead answer web_research
{question, why} (when [research] allows it and the caps leave a research run and a planner run),
and the research then gets the owner's command as typed (the planner's question only as a search
hint, and only when every word in it is the owner's). The research run's stdin is
ask.research.build_research_prompt's: the question, the date and time zone and Jarvis's limits,
never the calendar, mail, contacts, briefing, accounts or addresses. Its answer becomes cards
through ask.research_validate (AskOutcome.research holds the answer and the sources).

An Ask: caps and readiness first (refused without a run), then the context: the calendar of every
signed-in account, the briefing, and the text of briefing threads the request clearly names (on
accounts with "gmail_read"). The first run may ask to search mail instead of planning
({account, query, why}); Jarvis checks that search (ask.mail.check_query), runs it read-only on
that account, takes at most 3 threads, trims them and runs the planner once more with them as
quoted data (both runs count against the caps). Every line becomes a card through
validate.to_cards. Thread text lives only in this call's memory: it is never logged, saved or
returned; with [live] text on, the LIVE view shows it on screen (memory only, this session).

The UI calls plan() on its Ask worker thread (it blocks: Google reads and up to two CLI runs);
``on_stage`` reports STAGE_* as it goes, and setting ``cancel`` ends a running CLI within a second.
