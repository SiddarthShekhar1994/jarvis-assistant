"""One Ask from request to cards (at most two planner runs), and the checks that need no model request.

    ClaudeEngine(ask_config, data_dir, runner, environ)
        readiness(refresh=False)   Readiness: claude.exe found, its flags probed, a claude.ai
                                   subscription sign-in, an empty work folder. No model request;
                                   cached until a run fails
        run(prompt, allow_search, cancel, progress, capture)   RunResult of one planner run
                                   (stream.run_planner; progress / capture feed the LIVE view)
    ResearchEngine(research_config, base)   web research on the same Claude Code: readiness (also
                                   --allowedTools and an empty research folder) and research runs
                                   (ask.research.run_research)
    GoogleSources(config, calendars, senders, readers)   what Jarvis may tell the planner about each
                                   account (no sign-in ever; reads only)
    AskPlanner(config, engine, sources, usage, research=)
        plan(command, briefing, page_ids, cancel, on_stage, live, conversation) -> AskOutcome (``live``:
                                   the Ask's LIVE view task: every check, read, run and line, as it
                                   happens; ``conversation``: what was said before this request)
        dry_run(command, briefing, conversation) -> DryRun (the exact stdin text, email text, notes and
                                   the conversation as counts)
        research_dry_run(question) -> DryRun (a "web:" request's research stdin and command line)
    briefing_context(...)          the briefing as Ask may see it (pending cards, sections, deadlines)

Web research: a request that starts with "web:" (or "research:") reads nothing from the accounts
and runs one research run with the owner's words; planner run 1 may instead answer web_research
{question, why} (when [research] allows it and the caps leave a research run and a planner run),
and the research then gets the owner's command as typed (the planner's question only as a search
hint, and only when every word in it is the owner's). The research run's stdin is
ask.research.build_research_prompt's: the question, the date and time zone and Jarvis's limits,
never the calendar, mail, contacts, briefing, accounts or addresses. Its answer becomes cards
through ask.research_validate (AskOutcome.research holds the answer and the sources).

An Ask: caps and readiness first (refused without a run), then the context: the calendar of every
signed-in account, the briefing, and the text of briefing threads the request clearly names (on
accounts with "gmail_read"). The first run may ask to search mail instead of planning
({account, query, why}); Jarvis checks that search (ask.mail.check_query), runs it read-only on
that account, takes at most 3 threads, trims them and runs the planner once more with them as
quoted data (both runs count against the caps). Every line becomes a card through
validate.to_cards. Thread text lives only in this call's memory: it is never logged, saved or
returned; with [live] text on, the LIVE view shows it on screen (memory only, this session).

Memory (the productivity bundle): ``AskPlanner.memory`` gives the owner's notes (memory.json) to
every planner context as a <memory> block (never to web research: the research paths never build
a context); an Ask gets every note while they fit in 8 KB, else the ones closest to its command
first (memory.pick_notes). With ``memory_suggestions`` a planner run 1 whose stdin has no <mail> may
suggest one note ("remember"); memory.check_suggestion keeps it only when grounded in that run's own
context and not dismissed before (AskOutcome.suggestion; saved only on the owner's click in the app).

The conversation: plan() takes what was said before the request (``conversation``: the window's
conversation.Turn list of the last day, oldest first, taken when the request was accepted) and an Ask's
context shows its recent exchanges as <conversation> (ask.context: data for context only, never an id,
a typed address or a search's words). Only an Ask: web research, planner modes and the dry run of a
"web:" request never get it.

A task (Jarvis, a true agent; only while the app sets ``AskPlanner.agent_allowed``): a first run's schema and prompt
gain one more answer, agent_task (cli.AGENT_TASK_PROPERTY, the *_agent prompts). When it is used the outcome carries the
owner's own words (``AskOutcome.agent_task``), whatever the run wrote as the goal, and the app starts the task
(agent_ui). Off, not a word of it is in any schema or prompt. A second run, a mode's other than a desktop request's and
web research never get it.

The UI calls plan() on its Ask worker thread (it blocks: Google reads and up to two CLI runs);
``on_stage`` reports STAGE_* as it goes, and setting ``cancel`` ends a running CLI within a second.

An Ask's first words: ``on_words(run number, text, complete, mail)`` hears the planner's "say" as it is written
(stream.SayWatch; an Ask's runs only, never a mode's or web research's) - the final validated plan stays the source
of truth. With the prestart seam (ClaudeEngine.prestart: the app's engine, never a test's unless it asks) run 1 takes a
Claude Code started ahead of the question (ask.prestart: ``prestart_ask()`` after the readiness check, again right
after each use on the command line just used; ``prestart_sweep()`` recycles, ``prestart_shutdown()`` kills), `claude auth
status` runs alongside the context (ClaudeEngine.sign_in_ahead: it is still asked before every run), and the calendar
reads of an Ask's context may be up to RECENT_READ_S old, never past a change Jarvis made (GoogleSources.
recent_event_briefs; ``read_ahead()`` reads them as the owner starts typing). One log line per Ask gives the times.

Planner modes (the productivity bundle): plan_mode(request, inputs=, briefing=, ...) runs one mode
on the same thread and the same one-at-a-time lock as plan(). This build has the day plan
(ask.modes.MODE_PLAN, "plan my day"): the Ask caps plus the bundle's daily cap and the hourly
reserve for typed Asks, Claude Code ready, the personal calendar signed in; a fresh read of the day
being planned on every calendar account; the free stretches and what needs time (ask.dayplan),
where an empty day or a full one answers with no run at all; then one run with ClaudeEngine.run_mode
(its own system prompt and schema, no tools, no mail, no web, no second run) and its lines checked
by validate.to_cards(kinds={Calendar}, extra=dayplan.DayCheck) and keep_valid. Each valid block's
notes become "For: <the to-do it serves>" (Jarvis's own words) and ``serves`` names the Todo card.
plan_dry_run() shows the stdin with titles and notes as sizes (no run, nothing counted).

The meeting brief (ask.modes.MODE_PREP, "prep me for my 2 PM", spec 3.3): Ask on, nothing more up
front; the meeting read fresh (typed words resolved by ask.prep.resolve_meeting against today and
tomorrow: none, several, or one found by only some title words answer with no read at all; a
clicked meeting is found again by its calendar and id, wherever it moved; gone or ended stops).
Mail only when the meeting's account can be read, and only after Claude Code's readiness and the
caps (the bundle's too) were checked right then: else a brief of Jarvis's own, with no run (R12).
Each guest the meeting has (not the owner, a group or a guest who declined; at most
prep_max_guests) is looked up with Jarvis's own search (ask.prep.prep_query: that address, the
last prep_lookback_days days) after ask.prep.guest_allowed (R2), until 3 threads are found, one per
guest; those are read and given to one run (its own prompt and schema), whose answer is checked
(ask.prep.check_prep; its Reply lines by validate.to_cards with ask.prep.PrepCheck). No thread
found: the brief of Jarvis's own (who is coming, what each lookup found), no run. From the
follow-ups build a guest's newest thread on the meeting's account may come from the header scan's
participants index (ModeInputs.participants) instead of a search, always after guest_allowed (R2,
R3); a thread the planner marks as waiting on them, where Jarvis's own headers agree that the owner
wrote last, becomes a "Draft a nudge" target of the brief (PrepBrief.nudges, R32).

The meeting summary (ask.modes.MODE_MEETING, meetings part 2): the transcript of a meeting the owner
recorded is summarised only when he asked - his own "summarise it" tick on that meeting's start card (once
the transcript is ready), or his click on Summarise. The Ask caps and Claude Code ready (no bundle cap: it
counts as an Ask run); the transcript read on this thread from the meeting's folder (ModeRequest.payload,
an ask.meeting_summary.MeetingJob); one run with its own prompt and schema, the transcript marked as text
written by other people (data, never instructions) and the invite's guests by name only. The answer is checked
strictly
(meeting_summary.summary_from: the whole answer refused when it does not fit), then Jarvis's own checks
(meeting_summary.check_summary): on a linked call action items only for "you" or an invited guest, follow-ups
only to an invited guest (the invite's address, never one from the run) as Email cards through
validate.to_cards with meeting_summary.FollowupCheck; in person nothing is the owner's (every turn is "Room");
a meeting not linked to a calendar meeting gets no guests and keeps its follow-ups as plain text (no cards);
notes through memory.check_suggestion. Nothing is sent, added or kept here.

The drafted reply or nudge (ask.modes.MODE_NUDGE, a click on a FOLLOW-UPS row or under a brief,
spec 3.4): the Ask caps with the bundle's, Claude Code ready, the thread's account readable; the one
thread read in full (the only body read of a follow-up); ask.modes.nudge_guard stops with no run when
the owner replied since, they answered since or anything else changed; else one run with the
thread, <followup> and only the owner's own words from "Tell Jarvis what to say", and its one Reply
line checked by validate.to_cards with ask.modes.NudgeCheck.

A desktop request (ask.modes.MODE_DESKTOP, Jarvis on your desktop, P1.7): a request the owner typed that
no local route took (desktop.routes); ModeRequest.payload is an ask.desktop_mode.DesktopJob (its run id and
the context's candidates, names only). The Ask's checks (no bundle cap: it counts as an Ask run), one run
with its own prompt and schema and Ask's command line otherwise (no tools, no MCP, nothing saved, stdin
only), its answer read strictly (desktop_mode.plan_from: refused whole when it does not fit), then every
step checked by desktop.validate against this run's refs and the owner's typed words only (tiers, the NEVER
list, intent and scope licensing, the suspect rule, the phase gate, the rate caps). The checked plan is then
carried out through the desktop (DesktopJob.carry_out: the desktop thread re-checks each target right before its
one OS call - INSTANT steps open, ONE-CLICK and CARD steps wait for the owner's click; the Ask thread waits for it),
and the outcome carries the plan (``brief``), the run (``desktop_run``) and Jarvis's own words for them
(``message``; desktop.executor.run_words - a plan only checked: desktop_mode.plan_words).
