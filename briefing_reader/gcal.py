"""Google Calendar access for approved proposals and the day's agenda.

:class:`GoogleCalendar` turns an approved
:class:`~briefing_reader.actions.ProposedAction` into a calendar event, answers
invitations, moves and cancels events you organize, and reads the events the
reading window shows:

    sign_in()          OAuth installed-app flow in the user's browser (google_auth.GoogleAccount);
                       the token is saved in %LOCALAPPDATA%\\briefing-reader
    timezone()         the calendar's time zone setting (cached)
    find_existing(a)   an event with the same title and start, if there is one
    create_event(a)    find_existing first, else events.insert (never retried; a 5xx answer or
                       a lost answer is CalendarUnknownOutcome, and a retry finds the event)
    list_events(s, e)  CalendarEvents between two times; never signs in (raises
                       CalendarNotSignedIn instead)
    list_event_briefs(s, e)  what Ask Jarvis may see of those events (EventBrief: ids, title,
                       times, organizer, guests; never a description, location or link)
    get_event(id)      Google's own view of one event (EventDetails)
    respond(id, ...)   answer an invitation: events.patch with attendeesOmitted and only
                       your own attendee entry
    move(id, s, e)     new start and end for an event you organize (or may modify)
    cancel(id)         events.delete of an event you organize

``respond``, ``move`` and ``cancel`` always pass ``sendUpdates`` explicitly
(the REST default is "none"), fetch the event first and refuse what you may
not do (NotAllowed), and are never retried: a 5xx answer or a timeout after
the request went out raises CalendarUnknownOutcome (it may or may not have
happened), and the HTTP client never sends a change twice
(google_auth.single_send_http). They are idempotent (a second answer, move or
cancel finds it done and says ``already``), so a retry the user asks for
after an unknown outcome is safe. With ``interactive=False`` they never open
the browser sign-in (CalendarNotSignedIn instead).

A GoogleCalendar acts for one account (``account=``, see google_auth.py); the
old constructor (``client_secret_path`` + ``token_path``) builds a private
one, the single sign-in of older versions. Every call is blocking and may wait
on the network or, for sign-in, on the user's browser for up to
``open_timeout_s`` seconds, so callers run them on a worker thread. The Google
client libraries are imported lazily: importing this module stays cheap, needs
no Google package and never imports Qt.

The OAuth client secret and the access and refresh tokens are registered with
:func:`config.register_secret` as soon as they are read, so the log redacts
them. Exception messages carry only HTTP statuses, Google's error message
(redacted) and exception type names, never an event's title or guests; the log
names events by id only.
