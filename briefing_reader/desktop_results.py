"""Jarvis on your desktop: the result cards on the HUD and the window each one points at (SPEC sections 8.1, 8.4 and
10.3; owner decision D5; hard rules 4, 13, 14 and 17; Phase 1, part 9; DesktopB.dc.html's first demo).

``ResultCards`` shows a run's cards (desktop.results.Card, made on the desktop thread right after the run:
``DesktopRun.shown``) as hud_overlay.ResultCard windows - Tool, frameless, on top, never the focus, their buttons
NoFocus and acting on click - and keeps each card's OWN items for its clicks (verified review note: the resolved
target and its identity, never an id resolved again).

* A card for something that opened (D5: the best match is ALREADY OPEN) looks for the window it opened (desktop.
  winwatch: the app's exe - from the type's association for a file, the browser's for a web page, the Start menu's
  exe name for an app - a window not there before the request or the click (``snapshot()`` then), else the one in
  front; tried at once and a few times more within ``FIND_FOR_S``, then given up: bounded single shots, never a
  loop). Found: the card goes beside it (kept on screen, clear of the HUD and the other cards), a cyan bracket round
  it with the app's tag ("WORD") and a tether from it to the card - in the click-through DecorLayer (static: drawn
  again only when something changes) - and the window is followed (WinEvent hooks: a drag hides the bracket and the
  tether until it ends, a minimise until it is back, a move or a snap draws them again where it is; a close takes
  them away and the card stays). Physical pixels are mapped per monitor onto Qt's screens (winwatch.map_rect): a
  window over two screens gets a bracket on each; one that maps onto no screen gets none. A result card never
  brackets a File Explorer window; the NEEDS YOUR OK card of file steps does (P2.3, below).
* Not found, or a card with no window (a held step, what a find found): beside the HUD, under its bar and chips.
* A button's click comes out as ``clickRequested(entry, key)`` (desktop_ui carries it out on the desktop thread and
  hands what came of it back to ``apply_click``): an Open that opened replaces its card with the card of what opened;
  a step held again (a file that turned out to run macros) adds its amber card; a row whose item changed since goes;
  Not now (``DISMISS_KEY``) removes the card - nothing is carried out.
* ``clear()`` (a new request, leaving the HUD, Jarvis closing): every card, bracket, tether, hook and timer goes.
* P2.3, the NEEDS YOUR OK card of file steps (``show_tidy(state, text)``: hud_overlay.DesktopCard, its copy from
  desktop.tidy.tidy_text; ``refresh_tidy(text)`` as its state moves on; ``tidy()``; ``drop_tidy()``): it goes beside
  the File Explorer window showing the folder its items come from (winwatch.find_folder - looked for at once and a
  few times more, as a result card's window; none open: no bracket, the card under the HUD) with a cyan bracket round
  that window, the folder's name as its tag ("DOWNLOADS") and a tether, followed the same way. Its ticks and buttons
  come out as ``tidyTicked(number, ticked)`` and ``tidyClicked(key)`` - desktop_ui decides; the state is the
  controller's (desktop_ui keeps it while the HUD is away: this is only its view).

Logs carry counts, card kinds and event kinds only - never a name, a title, an exe or a path.
