Public API
==========

``paginate(text, max_words=14) -> list[str]``
    Caption pages (spec 14.2): split at sentence ends, then at clause marks (``,`` ``;`` `` - ``
    ``:``), then evenly, never between a number and its unit (``12:30 PM``), between two capitalised
    words (a name or title) or after a little word ("at", "the" ...).

``thinking_line(text) -> str``
    The command bar's working status as the caption's thinking line: no seconds counter (technical
    readouts live in LIVE) and at most 8 words.

``CaptionView``
    One caption at a time under the hero orb. ``set_resting(text)`` (the greeting, at most 6 words),
    ``set_question(text)`` (an open offer's question: shown instead of the greeting, in question type,
    until it is answered or expires; spec 14.5), ``set_thinking(text)`` (``ink-2`` line with the scan
    line under it), ``say(text, spoken=True, duration_ms=0, timeline=None, position=None)`` (pages of at
    most 14 words revealed word by word: with the utterance's voice_fx.VoiceTimeline and ``position()`` (how
    far its audio is, ms) each word shows as it is said - on edge-tts's word boundaries, else evenly over the
    audio's length; otherwise over ``duration_ms`` when the audio's length is known (a briefing item), else at
    the voice's estimated pace, ``SPOKEN_WPS``; muted or silent: ``MUTED_WPS``. Lively: the page's words wait
    as a faint blurred ghost and each one fades in from blurred to sharp as it is said (the motion prototype);
    calm: a plain fade; ``[ui] motion`` off or reduced motion: each page whole at once. The whole line is the
    accessible description from the start), ``finish()`` (the voice
    stopped: the last page shows whole and holds ``HOLD_SPOKEN_MS``, then fades to the resting line; a
    silent caption holds ``HOLD_MUTED_MS``). Times on a page (``10:30 AM``, the hour in "at 10") are
    ``holo``; amber never appears. ``state()`` is one of ``RESTING``, ``THINKING``, ``SPEAKING``,
    ``HOLDING``; ``stateChanged(str)``.
    ``stream(text, complete=False, spoken=True)``: an answer's words as they are written, ``text`` always the whole
    line so far (pages that never change as it grows: ``stream_pages``); no pace of its own: each word shows as it
    comes. A later ``say`` of the same words - the voice begins - takes the line over where it stands: nothing is typed
    again and nothing flickers, only the page turns and the words not shown yet follow the voice. ``complete`` with
    ``spoken`` False: no voice is coming (the muted pace from here). Written whole, it waits ``VOICE_WAIT_MS`` for its
    voice, and ``finish()`` (another utterance ending) does not end it meanwhile. ``correct(text, alert=False,
    spoken=True)``: the line was wrong (the final plan differs, the run failed): ``text`` replaces it at once and whole,
    in coral with ``alert``; its voice takes it over the same way. ``stream("")`` or ``clear()``: withdrawn at once.

``HoloHeader``
    The 52 px title bar of the main window (drag area): the ``J.A.R.V.I.S.`` wordmark and the state
    readout (7 px dot + mono word, ``set_state_word(word, tone)``), a note per service that is not
    OK (``set_service(name, status, tooltip)``: dot + mono name, the service chip's text as tooltip and
    accessible name; until round 2's error tiles), a Send's or Cancel's hidden hold away from its card
    (``set_hold(word)``: the confirmed "SENT" with an **Undo** link, ``undoClicked``; never a number),
    the "Find or ask anything" pill (``find_button``, a find_view.FindButton: ``findClicked``; Ctrl+K;
    folded to a round search button when the header is too narrow), then the clock button (opens the
    Day view: ``clockClicked``), a divider, mute (``muteClicked``; ``set_mute_visible``,
    ``set_muted``), minimize (``minimizeClicked``) and close = Done (``closeClicked``).
    ``type_wordmark()`` types J.A.R.V.I.S. in (the start-up: 1.1 s after 250 ms, letter by letter; the
    accessible name stays "Jarvis"), ``wordmark_typing()``.

``HomeStage``
    The stage: the hero orb (``hero``, an ``orb.OrbWidget`` sized to fit, 200-320 px) centred, four
    18 px corner brackets, a faint hairline through the orb, and the Transcript button bottom-left
    (``transcript_button``). Round 2, part 3a: ``set_side_tile(tile)`` puts the one amber tile (an offer,
    offer_view.OfferTile) bottom-right of the orb, tethered to it; the orb gives it room while it shows.
    Part B of the motion prototype: ``context`` (a context_view.ContextTiles) flies the greeting's context
    tiles out of the orb into the free places around it (never over the side tile or the Transcript button);
    a click on one emits ``contextClicked(target)``. The hero's widget gets room for its voice spikes.

``EchoPill``
    ``YOU`` + the owner's request in mono 13, under the orb while it is handled.

``Drawer``
    A panel that slides in from the right (420 wide, ``raised``, 280 ms in, 180 ms out), with a title
    and a close button; Esc closes it and the focus goes back to the opener. ``body_layout`` holds
    the content (the Transcript's conversation, the Day view's agenda); ``add_head_button`` puts a
    control of that content beside the close button (the Transcript's Clear conversation).

Settings has its own module since round 2, part 2b (settings_view.SettingsStage).
