"""The LIVE view's pictures, as plain data: what hud draws next to a step's text (Qt-free).

    Picture                           one picture of a LIVE step: its kind (KIND_*), caption, state
                                      (live.PICTURE_*), a one-line note, an accessible description and
                                      the data of its kind (MailPicture / DayPicture / WeekPicture /
                                      PagePicture); ``cost`` (bytes as counted against the LiveLimits
                                      picture caps), ``without_text()``, ``dropped(reason)``
    email_picture(thread, ...)        an email thread Ask read (MAIL_THREAD): the newest message as a mail
                                      client shows it, the older ones as short lines
    outgoing_picture(view, account=)  what a Reply / Email card sends (ACTION_PAYLOAD), exactly as built
    day_change_picture(action, ...)   a calendar card's change on its day (Calendar add, To-do block,
                                      Move, Cancel, RSVP), with the day's other events only when Jarvis
                                      had already read that day (KnownDays) - never a Google call for it
    week_picture(events, start, end, ...)   the 7 days of an Ask's calendar read (CALENDAR_READ)
    page_pending / page_ready / page_unavailable   a page snapshot of a web research's page read
    stamp(picture, status, status_text)     the stamp on an outgoing / calendar picture ("WILL BE SENT",
                                            "SENT", "UNDONE - NOT SENT" ...) and its tone
    KnownDays                         the days Jarvis already read (today's agenda, an Ask's calendar
                                      read): memory only, GUI thread
    CalendarRead                      what one Ask read from the calendars (AskOutcome.calendar_read)

Rules: every string in a picture went through live.clean_line / live.clean_block (secrets redacted,
control, bidi and invisible characters shown as "<U+202E>"), exactly like the LIVE text. Email and
calendar pictures are drawn by Jarvis from the plain text and times he already has: never email HTML,
never a remote image or font, nothing clickable. Pictures are memory only: nothing here writes a file,
logs, or touches the network; repr() of every object names kinds, states and sizes only.
