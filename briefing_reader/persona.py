"""What Jarvis says on his own, in his persona: concise, polite, British, "sir".

This module only builds sentences; it never speaks, logs or stores them.

* ``with_address(template, address)`` fills the address markers: ``{sir}``
  inside a sentence and ``{Sir}`` at its start ("Good morning, {sir}." ->
  "Good morning, sir."). With no address ("") the marker and its comma go
  ("Good morning.", "{Sir}, your AM ..." -> "Your AM ...").
* ``GREETINGS``: 24 short greetings with stable ids in five groups (morning,
  afternoon, evening, late night and neutral); ``bucket_for`` says which time
  group an hour belongs to and ``pick_greeting`` picks one at random that was
  not heard recently (never the last one).
* ``announcement``: "Sir, your AM briefing is ready to view." (after a greeting:
  "Your AM briefing is ready to view.").
* ``approvals_sentence`` and ``next_event_sentence``: the one fact a greeting
  may add, both safe to say aloud (a count; an event title and time, never
  email content or an address).
* ``compose_opening``: greeting + announcement + fact as one utterance of at
  most three sentences (the greeting then opens with a plain statement, never a
  question it does not wait for); ``salutation`` is the plain "Good morning,
  sir." of an hour (the prefix of a scheduled arrival's announcement).
* ``spoken_when``: "today at 3 PM", "tomorrow at 2:30 PM", "on Friday at 9 AM",
  "on October 12" for the sentences below.
* ``outcome_text`` / ``not_sent_text``: what Jarvis says after the executor
  carried out (or could not carry out) an approved card - the only place "Done"
  or "Sent" is ever said ("Done, sir - I've moved 'Project sync' to Friday at
  2 PM."); ``outcome_tone`` says how the conversation shows it. Never the
  error message, a body or a recipient.
* ``ask_reply_speech`` / ``ask_failure_speech`` / ``ACKS``: Ask's spoken answer
  (the planner's say and question only, guarded by ``claims_done``; the question
  is always kept, and after mail was read the say is kept short and never quotes
  it), its failures and the short "One moment, sir." while it plans.
* ``scrub_for_speech``: addresses, links and long ids out, at most 400
  characters cut at a sentence; every spoken text goes through it.
