"""Jarvis's own small preferences: ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\briefing-reader\\assistant.json``.

``{"muted": false, "recent_greetings": ["m3", "n1"]}``: whether the owner muted
Jarvis's voice (the header's speaker button) and the ids of the last few
greetings, so the next one differs; ``"answers_adopted": true`` once the
answers of an older version in runstate.json were taken as viewed (once, at
the first start after the update); ``"live_window": {"x", "y", "w", "h"}`` and
``"live_popped_out"``: where the LIVE pop-out window was and whether it was open
when Jarvis quit (written once the pop-out has been used); ``"prod_hint_shown":
true`` once the productivity bundle's one-time "minimize instead of Done" entry
was shown (R34); ``"followups_off": true`` while the follow-up list is turned off on
this PC (its section's "Turn off on this PC"); ``"desktop_turned_on": true`` once the
owner clicked Turn on on the first-run "Jarvis on your desktop" card (Settings >
Desktop's Turn off takes it away again), with ``"desktop_consent_version": 2`` once the
card he turned on listed Phase 2's rows (none: Phase 1's card, version 1). Ids, numbers
and booleans only: never any text (the LIVE view's steps are never saved).

The file is written atomically (temporary file + ``os.replace``); a missing,
corrupt or unwritable file counts as the defaults and never stops the app
(a failed write is logged and kept in memory for this run) - except the desktop
OK, which is fail-closed: it counts only once it is saved (a Turn on that could
not be written is undone in memory too), and anything but a stored ``true`` is no.

Qt-free; standard library only.
