"""Who a Reply or Email goes to: the own-address refusal and the NEW RECIPIENT check.

Jarvis never sends a message to the account it sends from. An address is that account's own
mailbox (OWN) also when it is written another way: other upper / lower case, spaces around it,
a "+tag" after the name (Gmail delivers "ana+notes@example.edu" to "ana@example.edu") or, for
gmail.com / googlemail.com, dots in the name. A card that names its own account in To or Cc is
refused as it stands ("This would send to the work account (ana@example.edu) itself - edit the
recipients"): such a card is a slip of the briefing, or its alias is bound to the wrong Google
account, so nothing is quietly left out and nothing goes out until the address is removed in
Edit.

Sending never reads a thread to prove that an address belongs in it. Instead an address needs no
extra confirmation only when it is

- in a domain of ``[actions] trusted_domains``, or a subdomain of one (empty by default), or
- an address Jarvis sent to before (RecipientHistory: recipients.json).

Every other address is NEW: its card shows a red NEW RECIPIENT chip and Send waits until it is
ticked in the Edit dialog ("Send to <address>"; ProposedAction.confirmed, memory only).
Addresses are compared as plain, casefolded addresses; a display name never counts. A recipient
that Ask Jarvis proposed and you did not type (ProposedAction.unverified) skips the trusted
domains: it is NEW unless Jarvis sent to it before.

    mailbox_key(address)      the mailbox an address delivers to (only for comparing addresses)
    same_mailbox(a, b)        both are the same mailbox (case, spaces, +tag, Gmail dots aside)
    own_recipients(...)       the recipients that are the sending account itself
    RecipientHistory(path)    %LOCALAPPDATA%\\briefing-reader\\recipients.json: the sha256 of each
                              address Jarvis sent to and when (never the address itself)
    classify(addresses, ...)  address -> OWN / TRUSTED / KNOWN / NEW
    review(to, cc, ...)       what a card shows and Send needs: the recipients, which of them are
                              the account itself (Send refuses), which are new, which of those
                              are still unconfirmed

Qt-free. Logs carry counts only, never an address or a hash.
