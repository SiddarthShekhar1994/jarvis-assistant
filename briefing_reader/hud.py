"""Jarvis HUD widget kit: theme tokens, fonts, painting helpers and widgets.

The look follows the user's "Jarvis HUD - sci-fi" artboard: a near-black
ground with a faint cyan grid, chamfered (cut-corner) panels, cyan accents,
amber for anything that needs the user's OK, and three typefaces: Chakra Petch
(wordmark), Sora (prose) and JetBrains Mono (labels, meta, numbers). Every
widget paints itself with QPainter; nothing here knows about briefings,
Notion or Google, so ``ui.py`` composes the views from these parts. The
imports from the package are the Qt-free clock formatter
(``text_prep.clock_parts`` / ``format_time``), so every screen writes times
the same way, the LIVE view's Qt-free event types and words (``live``) and its
pictures as plain data (``pictures``).

Public API
==========

Tokens and fonts
    Colour constants (hex strings): ``GROUND``, ``TEXT_BRIGHT``, ``TEXT_BODY``,
    ``TEXT_SOFT``, ``TEXT_MUTED``, ``TEXT_DIM``, ``TEXT_SUB``, ``TEXT_TIME``,
    ``ACCENT`` (+ ``_HOVER``/``_PRESSED``/``_INK``), ``AMBER`` (+ ``_HOVER``/
    ``_PRESSED``/``_INK``/``_TEXT``/``_SUB``/``_META``), ``GREEN``, ``RED``,
    ``RED_LINE``, ``PINK``, ``SLATE``, ``OFF``; QColors ``PANEL_GROUND`` and
    ``AMBER_GROUND``; ``rgba(color, alpha) -> QColor``.
    ``load_fonts(fonts_dir) -> dict[str, str]`` registers the bundled TTFs
    (call once after QApplication exists; missing files are logged and the
    font helpers fall back to Bahnschrift / Segoe UI / Cascadia Mono, Consolas).
    ``display_font(px, weight, spacing)``, ``body_font(...)``, ``mono_font(...)``
    return QFonts; ``spacing`` is CSS letter-spacing in em.
    ``apply_theme(app)``: Fusion, HUD palette, Sora 13 px and a stylesheet for
    tooltips, scroll bars, menus and transparent text browsers/scroll areas.
    ``make_label(text, font, color, wrap=, name=)`` plain-text QLabel;
    ``set_label_color(label, color)``; ``SpeechLabel`` (QLabel with a real
    line height and optional ``max_lines`` elision; ``text()`` returns the
    plain text that was set, ``shown_text()`` what is displayed).

Painting helpers
    Corner flags ``CUT_TL``, ``CUT_TR``, ``CUT_BR``, ``CUT_BL``, ``CUT_DIAGONAL``
    (top-left + bottom-right, the default), ``CUT_TOP``.
    ``chamfer_path(rect, cut, corners) -> QPainterPath``.
    ``paint_ground(painter, rect, glow_center=None, glow_radii=None)``: ground
    colour, 48 px grid and the soft radial cyan glow.
    ``glow_pixmap(path, color, blur, dpr=1.0, key=None) -> (QPixmap, QPointF)``:
    a cached, blurred copy of ``path`` (CSS box-shadow ``0 0 <blur>px``).
    ``paint_row_highlight(painter, rect, color=ACCENT, strength=1.0)``: the
    agenda-row look (3 px glowing bar on the left + left-to-right gradient),
    shared by ``SectionList`` and the transcript highlight.
    ``paint_dash_bar(painter, rect, fraction, color)``: segmented telemetry bar.

Widgets
    ``HudWindowFrame(QWidget)``: frameless, translucent, always-on-top window
        with chamfered outer corners, painted ground (``set_glow_anchor``), a
        ``header`` (HeaderBar; its close button calls ``close()``, its minimize
        button ``showMinimized()``), ``body`` / ``body_layout`` for the
        content, optional edge resizing (``set_resizable``). It has a taskbar
        button (a top-level window with no owner, never a tool window), which
        restores it when minimized and minimizes it when it is in front.
    ``HeaderBar``: logo, JARVIS wordmark, subtitle, ServiceChips
        (``set_service(name, status, tooltip)``), date + clock updated each
        minute (``set_clock(callable)``, ``clock_texts()``; "1:52 PM" with a
        small "PM", or "13:52" after ``set_hour24(True)``), drag-to-move,
        ``minimize_button`` (accessible name "Minimize") ->
        ``minimizeRequested`` and ``close_button`` (accessible name "Close")
        -> ``closeRequested``, side by side at the right end.
        Narrow bars drop the subtitle, then the date, then tighten the chips
        and the room around them (``compact_level()``), so the prompt still
        fits. ``set_service_visible(name, bool)`` hides a chip without its room
        (Ask Jarvis's ``claude`` chip on the narrow prompt).
    ``ServiceChip``: statuses ``STATUS_OK`` / ``STATUS_WARN`` / ``STATUS_ERROR``
        / ``STATUS_OFF``.
    ``ChamferPanel(title, meta, variant=PANEL_CYAN|PANEL_AMBER, cut, corners)``:
        ``body_layout`` (QVBoxLayout below the title row), ``set_title``,
        ``set_meta``.
    ``MainPanel``: the transcript panel (top corners cut 10 px) with a header
        strip holding ``steps`` (StepStrip) and ``live`` (LiveMarker)
        (``strip_layout`` takes more widgets), and ``body_layout`` for the
        text browser.
    ``HudButton(text, variant, compact=False)``: QPushButton painted per
        variant ``PRIMARY``, ``SECONDARY``, ``DENY``, ``APPROVE``, ``LINK``;
        never default/autoDefault, Tab focus only, ring on keyboard focus,
        ``set_selected`` (secondary), ``set_variant``, ``set_link_color``.
    ``Orb(size=168, state=ORB_STANDBY)``: ``set_state``, ``state()``,
        ``set_phase(seconds or None)`` (freeze for screenshots),
        ``set_animated(bool)``, ``is_animating()``. ~30 fps only while visible
        and not minimized. States in ``ORB_STATES`` (colour, label).
    ``StateLabel``: blinking square + state text (``set_state(state, text=None)``).
    ``TelemetryBar(label, value, fraction, color)``: ``set_value`` (with an
        optional ``short`` form shown when the value does not fit), ``shown_value()``.
    ``SectionList`` (scroll area of ``SectionRow`` buttons): ``set_rows`` with
        ``SectionRowInfo``, ``set_row_state``, ``row(i)``, ``ensure_visible``,
        ``content_height()``, ``rowClicked(int)``. Row states ``ROW_PLAYED``,
        ``ROW_CURRENT``, ``ROW_UPCOMING``, ``ROW_IGNORED``.
    ``AgendaPanel(title)``: the TODAY / TOMORROW agenda (``AgendaRow`` from
        ``AgendaRowInfo``: a glowing 3 px bar, mono time ("12:30 PM" drawn as
        "12:30" over a small "PM"), title, meta; states
        ``AGENDA_UPCOMING`` cyan, ``AGENDA_NOW`` green, ``AGENDA_PAST`` dim) or
        one message line with an optional link (``set_message``,
        ``linkClicked``), then DEADLINES (``DeadlineRow`` from
        ``DeadlineRowInfo``; the due label is red / amber / grey for
        ``URGENCY_HIGH`` / ``URGENCY_MEDIUM`` / ``URGENCY_LOW``). It scrolls
        inside the panel.
    ``ChipButton(text)``: a small checkable chamfered toggle with a count and
        a caret (``set_meta``), e.g. SECTIONS in the transcript strip.
    ``Popover(title, meta)``: a frameless popup around ``panel`` (a
        ChamferPanel); ``open_below(anchor, width, height)``, ``closed``.
    ``StepStrip``: ``set_steps([(label, STEP_DONE|STEP_ACTIVE|STEP_TODO|STEP_DENIED)])``.
    ``LiveMarker``: blinking red dot + LIVE; ``set_live(bool)`` (keeps its space).
    ``ActionCard(action_id, kind, title, detail, actionable=True, *,
        approve_text="Approve", body="", title_lines=0, open_text="",
        copy_text="", edit_text="", sign_in_text="", check_line=False)``:
        ``set_status(CARD_*, message="", link="", link_text="")`` (``CARD_DONE``
        reads DONE and ``CARD_SENT`` its message ("ACCEPTED", "SENT") in green;
        ``set_undo("Undo" | "Retry" | "")`` shows Undo at the left of an ADDED /
        SENT result (never a countdown or a number); ``CARD_UNKNOWN`` keeps Deny / the right button and
        shows the reason under them in amber; ``link_text`` names the result's
        link, "Open" by default), ``set_approve_text(text)`` ("Retry",
        "Sign in", "Done": a card built with ``check_line=True`` is as wide
        as any of them from the start; on a narrow card Deny / Approve may
        lose some side padding, never their text), ``set_check_line(text,
        tooltip="", warn=False)`` (a two-line line under the detail, reserved
        when the card is built with ``check_line=True``; ``warn`` draws it in
        amber; ``check_warns()``), ``set_texts`` and ``set_body`` (they may
        make the card taller, never shorter), ``set_copy_text(text)`` (show,
        rename or hide Copy after an edit), ``set_edit_enabled(bool)``,
        ``set_sign_in_visible(bool)`` (a card built with ``sign_in_text``),
        ``set_note(text)``, ``note()``, ``result_text()``, ``title()``,
        ``body()``, ``show_copied()``, signals ``approveClicked(str)``,
        ``denyClicked(str)``, ``openClicked(str)`` (the link),
        ``undoClicked(str)``, and ``sourceClicked(str)`` / ``copyClicked(str)``
        / ``editClicked(str)`` / ``signInClicked(str)`` (the action id, from the
        tools row's Open / Copy / Edit / Sign in links). Deny / Approve
        and the result (WORKING..., ADDED + Open, DENIED, ...) share one
        fixed-height slot, so a status change never changes the card's height
        and the cards below never move; the FAILED / UNKNOWN reason and the
        note sit under the buttons and may only make a card taller. The body
        preview (three lines), the check line and the tools row sit above the
        slot and never change height by themselves (the Sign in link keeps its
        place while hidden). ``set_locked(bool,
        tooltip)`` dims Deny / Approve (a click on them emits
        ``lockedClicked(str)``); the tools row is never locked. ``COPIED_TEXT``
        / ``COPIED_MS`` are the Copy feedback; ``plain_tooltip(text)`` makes a
        tooltip that keeps line breaks and is never read as HTML (every
        tooltip that can hold page or calendar text uses it).
        A Reply / Email card is built with ``mail=True`` (``body_lines``,
        ``body_links``, ``approve_alternatives``): ``set_recipients(sender, to,
        cc)`` shows FROM and the TO / CC chips (``RecipientChips`` of
        ``RecipientChip(address, state)``; ``RECIPIENT_NEW`` is red with a NEW
        RECIPIENT badge, ``RECIPIENT_CONFIRMED`` reads NEW \u00b7 CONFIRMED),
        and the drafted text keeps its line breaks, up to ``body_lines`` lines,
        its links highlighted (``mail_text()``).
        ``EditDialog(action_id, kind, kind_label, title, ...)``: the window-modal
        Edit dialog of an RSVP / Move / Cancel card, or of a Reply / Email
        (``EDIT_MAIL_KINDS``: FROM, To / Cc rows with Remove, Add and a "Send to"
        tick per new recipient, the subject and the message) (``open()``;
        ``saved(id, values)``, ``show_error(text)``, ``values()``). ``ActionList``:
        scrollable cards ``ActionList.CARD_GAP`` px apart with an empty-state
        line (``add_card``, ``card(id)``, ``cards()``, ``clear()``,
        ``set_empty_text``); ``add_group_header(title, count)`` puts a
        ``GroupHeader`` ("ASK \u00b7 2") before the cards added after it
        (``group_headers()``).
    ``CommandBar``: Ask Jarvis's typed bar: a chamfered field (as long as
        QLineEdit takes, ``COMMAND_MAX_LENGTH``; plain text, ``COMMAND_PLACEHOLDER``)
        with its Ask button, a status line (``set_status(text, TONE_*)``, two
        lines, the whole text on hover) and a meta line with an optional link
        (``set_meta``, ``set_link(text, tooltip)``). Signals ``submitted(str)``
        (Enter or Ask, whitespace collapsed, never while running or empty),
        ``cancelRequested`` (Cancel or Esc while ``set_running(True)``),
        ``linkClicked`` and ``statusDismissed`` (Esc in an empty idle field);
        ``take_request(text)`` clears an accepted request at once and Up in the
        empty field brings it back (Down clears it again);
        ``set_compact(True)`` for narrow or short screens; ``focus_input()``.
        Its height never changes with its texts.
    ``ActivityLog``: ``add(tag, message, sub="", when=None)`` newest first,
        at most ``ActivityLog.MAX_ENTRIES``; tags ``TAG_RUN``, ``TAG_DONE``,
        ``TAG_WAIT``, ``TAG_STOP``, ``TAG_ASK``; ``entries()``; ``set_hour24(bool)``.
        Its rows are in the hologram look (``activity_tag_color``: never amber).
    ``TabStrip(live=False)``: the JARVIS / BRIEFING folder tabs above the
        centre panel (``TAB_JARVIS``, ``TAB_BRIEFING``; ``currentChanged(int)``,
        ``set_current``, ``current()``, ``set_badge(bool)`` = the amber NEW
        pill on BRIEFING, ``set_unread(bool)`` = a dot on JARVIS,
        ``set_compact(bool)``, automatic below ``max(TabStrip.COMPACT_BELOW,
        natural_width())`` px, the natural width counting every badge so a dot
        never flips it); each tab is a ``TabButton`` (Left / Right move between
        the shown tabs). ``live=True`` adds LIVE (``TAB_LIVE``, accessible
        name "Live steps"): ``set_live_visible(bool)`` (hidden, it is never
        current and Left / Right skip it), ``set_activity(state)`` its dot
        (``ACTIVITY_UNREAD`` steady, ``ACTIVITY_WORKING`` blinking on the
        shared blink clock; none while LIVE is current), ``activity()``.
    ``LiveLog(clock=time.monotonic)``: the LIVE view (live.py's stream): one
        chamfered card per task (the pinned "Background reads" first, then
        oldest -> newest), its header a button (tag pill, the title in at most
        two lines, the status pill with the running time or "SENDING IN 7 S",
        the meta line; a compact task is one line until opened) and its steps
        as button rows (status glyph, title, summary, status word over the
        elapsed time; click, Space or Enter shows / hides the details: fields
        in two columns from ``LIVE_FIELDS_MEDIUM_PX`` up (the label column
        narrower below ``LIVE_FIELDS_WIDE_PX``), items, notes, and
        collapsible read-only text blocks made on their first open, at most
        ``LIVE_TEXT_MAX_PX`` tall, "written by other people" on untrusted
        ones). ``apply(live.LiveChanges)`` redoes only tasks whose revision
        changed; ``clear()``, ``set_hour24``, ``task_widget(id)``,
        ``step_widget(id)``, ``task_ids()``, ``reveal(task_id)``,
        ``following()``, ``scroll_to_newest()``, ``tick()``, ``ticking()``;
        ``linkClicked(str)`` (a result link or an internal id such as
        "tab:jarvis"). Plain text only (painted, PlainText labels, a read-only
        QPlainTextEdit); it follows the newest step unless the owner scrolled
        in the last 4 s (what came meanwhile is followed when the hold ends),
        keeps an approved card's payload in view during a Send's hidden hold
        (a card just approved comes into view whatever was scrolled), shows its
        empty-state text while only the pinned row is there, and keeps its
        column at most ``LIVE_CONTENT_MAX_PX`` wide; its timer ticks
        every second while a step runs, never while
        hidden, minimized or idle; Tab walks the rows in the order they are
        shown. A step with a picture shows it first in its details (a
        thumbnail button: Enter, Space or a click opens it larger);
        ``open_picture(step_id)`` shows a READY picture in the viewer,
        ``picture_viewer()`` (None until one was opened); during a hold a
        short view shows the payload picture's changed part. A field's
        "picture:<step id>" link (a research's check pointing at a source's
        picture) is followed here (``follow_link``): that picture larger (its
        close gives the focus back to the link, scrolled into view), or that
        step (``reveal_step``) while its picture is not READY (the keyboard
        focus the link had goes along, to that step's picture).
        ``fold=True`` (the Live screen and its pop-out): every step is one
        line and a click only makes it the focal step; only a hidden hold's
        payload step opens (``folded()``).
    LIVE pictures (pictures.py's data, drawn in the HUD theme at the size
        shown): ``picture_height(picture, width, stamp=, max_height=)``,
        ``paint_picture(painter, rect, picture, stamp=, max_height=)``,
        ``picture_pixmap(picture, width, dpr=, stamp=, max_height=)`` (a picture
        taller than ``max_height`` is cut with a fade and "Enter: see all"),
        ``picture_focus(...)`` (where a calendar change's changed blocks are),
        ``week_label`` / ``week_labels`` (the week strip's day labels, one form
        for all), ``search_address_lines(hit, width)`` (a search result's
        address line: its site first, cut in the middle when too wide),
        ``picture_state_text(picture)``; the caps
        ``LIVE_PICTURE_MAX_W``, ``LIVE_PICTURE_MAIL_MAX_PX``,
        ``LIVE_PICTURE_DAY_MAX_PX``, ``LIVE_PICTURE_WEEK_MAX_PX``,
        ``LIVE_PICTURE_PAGE_MAX_PX``, ``LIVE_PICTURE_SEARCH_MAX_PX`` (a web
        search drawn as a compact results page), ``LIVE_PICTURE_PENDING_PX``.
        ``PictureViewer(parent)``: a picture larger inside Jarvis (non-modal;
        ``show_picture(step_id, picture, stamp, title)``, ``refresh``,
        ``step_id()``, ``picture()``, ``closed(step_id)``; Esc / Enter / Space /
        Ctrl+W close it; at most ``PICTURE_VIEWER_SCREEN`` of its screen, an
        email or calendar picture at most ``PICTURE_VIEWER_MODEL_W`` wide, a page
        at most ``PICTURE_VIEWER_PAGE_W``); it keeps nothing once closed.
    ``LiveStatus``: the LIVE page's tag in the strip (``set_state(LIVE_IDLE |
        LIVE_WORKING | LIVE_HOLD, text=None, since=)``, ``text()``: "IDLE",
        "WORKING 0:12", "SENDING" (a Send's hidden hold: the confirmed look, never
        a number)); it blinks only while working or holding. ``paint_status_glyph(painter, rect,
        status, opacity=1.0)`` draws live.STATUS_*'s glyph (running square, ok
        check, warn triangle, blocked octagon, failed cross, cancelled dash);
        ``live_status_color(status)``.
    ``ConversationLog``: Jarvis's conversation, oldest first, never elided
        (``add(role, text, when=, stamp=, tone=, sub=, link_text=, link_id=) -> id``,
        ``update(id, ...)``, ``entries()``, ``kept_entries()``, ``clear()``,
        ``set_hour24``; roles ``ROLE_JARVIS`` / ``ROLE_YOU``; ``linkClicked(link_id)``,
        ``changed`` when what an entry says changes); it follows the newest
        entry unless the owner scrolled in the last 4 s.
    ``HudChip(text, color)``: small chamfered tag (e.g. "2 NEED YOUR OK").
    ``FlowLayout(h_spacing, v_spacing)``: wrapping row for buttons, so a
        narrow column gets two rows instead of a wider window.

Notes for integration:
* Every clickable thing is a real QAbstractButton with Tab focus (HudButton,
  SectionRow, the close button), so a Space shortcut filter that checks
  ``isinstance(watched, QAbstractButton)`` covers them all. Focus rings show
  for keyboard focus only (Tab, Backtab, shortcuts), like CSS :focus-visible.
* PRIMARY / APPROVE glows are QGraphicsDropShadowEffects: a child cannot paint
  outside its parent, so leave ~8 px between such a button and the edge of
  the widget that holds it, or that side of the glow is cut off.
* Timers (orb animation, blinking, clock) only run while their widget is shown.
* Widths: the regular reading controls (Pause, Skip section, Read everything,
  Open in Notion, Done) need ~570 px in one row (~505 compact); put them in a
  FlowLayout or give the center column that much room.

    """An approval card: kind, title, detail, then one fixed-height slot with Deny / Approve or the result.

    Round 2 (HOLOGRAM_SPEC 5, 6, 8, 9, 16.2): a hologram tile (amber while a decision waits, the done look
    once it is carried out, steel when denied, coral when it failed), the kicker with its 7 px dot, the
    title in the screen-title type, the facts readout, FROM / TO / CC chips, the NEW RECIPIENT ticks
    (``ticks``, ``tickToggled(action_id, address, ticked)``: Send stays disabled while one is not ticked,
    the helper line ``tick_hint`` says "Tick <address> first, then Send."), the message, then the action
    row: the tools slot (Edit / Sign in / Open event) and Deny as amber ghosts, the commit on the right.
    The result stamp (with Undo beside it while Jarvis's change can still be reversed: ``set_undo``)
    replaces that row in place; there is never a countdown.
    ``set_focal(True)``: the screen's focal card (all four brackets).

    Phase 2 additions: ``check_line=True`` reserves three lines under the detail for
    Google's own view of the event (``set_check_line``; whatever arrives by itself
    goes there, so it never moves the cards) and lets the kind label wrap once (an
    edited card's " \u00b7 EDITED"); ``edit_text`` adds an Edit link (``editClicked``,
    ``set_edit_enabled``) as the tools row's last place, which can show a Sign in link
    instead (``sign_in_text``, ``signInClicked``) or an "Open event" link to Google's
    own page of the event (``event_text``, ``sourceClicked``): ``set_tool_slot``; the
    three are equally wide, so switching never moves anything. ``set_copy_text``
    shows Copy once an edit adds a note; ``set_undo("Undo")`` shows an Undo button
    at the left of an ADDED / SENT result, away from Approve (``undoClicked``;
    ``set_undo("Retry")`` after a failed reversal, ``set_undo("")`` hides it); CARD_UNKNOWN keeps the
    buttons like FAILED, with the reason in amber; ``set_approve_text`` renames the
    right-hand button ("Retry", "Sign in", "Done") without moving the left-hand one
    (the button is as wide as its widest text from the start); ``deny_text`` names
    the left-hand one ("Skip").

    The slot swaps its content (the buttons, or a result such as ADDED with an
    "Open" link) but never its height, so a click never moves this card or the
    cards below it, and a second click at the same spot cannot land on another
    card's button. FAILED keeps the buttons (to retry) and shows the reason
    under them, cut to two lines (the whole reason is the tooltip); that line
    and the amber note (``set_note``) let the card grow downward by a bounded
    amount, but a card never gets shorter again. ``actionable=False``
    makes an informational card (no buttons, dim kind). ADDED / EXISTS show
    the "Open" link when a link is known (``openClicked(link)``).

    ``approve_text`` names the right-hand button ("Approve", "Add block",
    "Done"); ``title_lines`` cuts the title to that many lines (0 = never);
    ``body`` adds a three-line preview of a drafted text (hover for all of
    it). ``open_text`` / ``copy_text`` add a tools row of links above the
    slot ("Open thread" -> ``sourceClicked(action_id)``, "Copy reply" ->
    ``copyClicked(action_id)``; ``show_copied()`` reads "Copied" for 1.5 s).
    The tools row is there from the start, is never locked or hidden, and
    its buttons keep their width, so nothing in it moves.

    ``set_locked(True, tooltip)`` disables (dims) Deny / Approve without any
    change in size, for example while another card's approval runs; a click
    on a locked button emits ``lockedClicked(action_id)`` instead of
    ``approveClicked`` / ``denyClicked``, so the caller can log it.

    and the note (an RSVP's note goes to the organizer with the answer; a move's
    or cancel's note is not sent by Google Calendar, which the dialog says).
    A Reply / Email (EDIT_MAIL_KINDS) shows FROM (read only), the To and Cc
    recipients (Remove; Add checks the address with ``normalize`` and
    ``classify``; a new recipient is coral with its NEW RECIPIENT badge: it is
    ticked on the card, never here), the subject (an Email's can be changed; a
    reply keeps its thread's) and the message exactly as it will be sent, its
    links highlighted (``find_links``). ``banner`` is an amber line at the top
    (why the dialog opened: a long message to read).
    The subject and the message are shown whole (their fields grow with the
    text). The dialog always fits the screen's available area
    (QScreen.availableGeometry, at any display scale): when its content is
    taller, the fields between the banner and Save / Cancel scroll (an
    invitation's too), so Save is always on screen. ``whole_seen()``
    says whether all of the fields have been on screen (the message's end
    included) while the dialog was open. An address typed into Add but not
    added keeps the dialog open on Save (it would not be sent), and so does
    the sending account's own address in To or Cc (red, SENDING ACCOUNT:
    Remove it).
    Save emits ``saved(action_id, values)`` with the fields as typed (``values()``:
    answer, notify ("all" / "external" / "none"), date, start, end, note; or for
    a Reply / Email: to, cc, subject, body); the caller checks them and either closes the dialog
    (``accept()``) or keeps it open with ``show_error(text)``. Save never sends

    Enter (or Ask) emits ``submitted(text)`` with the whitespace collapsed; an empty field or a
    running request emits nothing. While a request runs (``set_running(True)``) the field is read
    only and the button reads Cancel: it, and Esc in the field, emit ``cancelRequested``. Esc
    otherwise clears the field, and in an empty field emits ``statusDismissed`` (the owner puts
    the last answer away). ``set_status(text, tone)`` (TONE_*) shows at most two lines (the
    whole text is the tooltip); ``set_meta(text)`` one line; ``set_link(text, tooltip)`` the link
    (``linkClicked``; "" hides it; never shown while a request runs). ``set_compact(True)`` (a
    narrow or short reading screen) drops the meta line (its text goes into the status tooltip)
    and puts the link beside the status while the bar is idle (TONE_IDLE) or the status asks for
    it (``set_status(..., keep_link=True)``), so the controls below keep their room and an answer
    keeps the whole width. ``set_hint(text)`` is the status with nothing to report: the status and
    meta lines fold away (the field's placeholder and tooltip say it) unless a link is to be
    shown, so the transcript below keeps its room; anything else the bar says brings them back.
    Otherwise the bar's height changes only with ``set_compact``, never with its texts. The field
    takes as much as QLineEdit holds (COMMAND_MAX_LENGTH) and never reads its text as HTML.

    The bar's owner says when Jarvis accepted a request typed here (``take_request(text)``: an Ask
    or a typed mode started, a shortcut was taken): the field is cleared at once - the words are in
    the conversation - while it still holds exactly them. Up in the empty field (nothing running)
    brings the last accepted request back to edit and send again; Down clears it again while it is

    rolling "Background reads" pinned first) as a card of its steps, newest at the bottom.

    ``apply(changes)`` takes a live.LiveChanges (only tasks whose revision changed are redone;
    ``removed`` ids go; ``reset`` replaces everything). Every text is plain text (painted, or a
    PlainText QLabel / read-only QPlainTextEdit); nothing is a link but a field's result link
    (``linkClicked(link)``: a Jarvis-made Google result link or an internal id such as
    "tab:jarvis"; a "picture:<step id>" link is followed here: follow_link), and nothing loads
    from anywhere. Details and text blocks are made on their
    first open. The elapsed times tick with the view's own timer: every second while a step runs,
    never while hidden, minimized or idle; running glyphs
    blink on the shared blink clock. It follows the newest step unless the owner scrolled in the
    last ``SCROLL_HOLD_S`` seconds (a new task is shown from its header; what came during the hold
    is followed when it ends). During a Send's or Cancel's hidden hold, what it will send or change
    (its payload step) stays in view, and a card the owner just approved comes into view whatever
    he scrolled. ``reveal(task_id)`` scrolls to a task and opens it. The empty-state text shows
    while no task but the pinned "Background reads" is there. The column is at most
    LIVE_CONTENT_MAX_PX wide. ``clock``: monotonic seconds (the stream's clock).

    Round 2 (HOLOGRAM_SPEC 16.3): it is the Live screen's timeline. A click on a step's row also says
    ``stepSelected(step_id)`` (the screen makes it the focal step: ``set_focal_step`` marks its row);
    ``changed`` follows every apply or clear and ``ticked`` every tick of its timer (nothing ticks while
    the view is hidden or minimized).
    ``hints=False`` (the pop-out: "details collapsed") opens a step's details only when the owner does;
    ``thumb=(w, h)`` draws the pictures in the details as thumbnails at most that big (the focal frame
    shows them large). ``fold=True`` (the Live screen and its pop-out, the owner's choice): every step
    is one line (status mark, title, time) and a click, Space or Enter on it only makes it the focal
    step (its picture and exact text are the focal frame's); the one step that opens, by itself, is
    what a Send or Cancel will send or change (its payload step) during its hidden hold.
