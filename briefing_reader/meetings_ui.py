"""Meeting recording, part 1: the app's side ([meetings] enabled; the AppController makes one ``MeetingsController``).

It ties the parts together and keeps the owner's rules:

* A recording starts ONLY in ``start_recording(request)`` - the start card's Start, which exists only while the
  consent tick is ticked; the request must carry ``consent=True`` again here. Nothing else calls it: not the
  voice, not Ask, not an offer, not the Find list (its "Record a meeting" only opens the card).
* While it records: REC with the time and Stop in the header (every screen) and on Home, the orb's recording look,
  the Dock's coral dot on Meetings, the always-on-top pill (also while Jarvis is minimised or hidden; held hidden
  while the desktop HUD shows, where REC is a chip: ``pillCreated`` hands it over) and the tray tooltip ("Jarvis:
  Recording 12:04"). Stop works from the pill, the header, Home and the Meetings screen; the recorder stops by
  itself at the end time + 15 min, after 10 min of silence on both channels or at 3 h, and ``shutdown()`` (Jarvis
  closing) stops and saves.
* After a stop the meeting is written down in a background process (low priority) when the faster-whisper add-on
  and the speech model are there; the model is downloaded only by ``download_model()`` - the owner's click on
  Download (Settings > Meetings or the Meetings screen). Retention runs at start-up and daily (a meeting it
  removes is announced like a Delete: ``meetingDeleted``, so its waiting drafts and notes go too).
* The start card closes - both ticks unticked - when the Meetings screen gives way to another, when the window is
  hidden or minimised, and its consent tick counts for CONSENT_FRESH_S only: a tick is never carried over to
  another call. The meeting record keeps when the box was ticked.
* The device library is made fresh for each start card, Settings > Meetings and each start (PortAudio lists the
  devices only when it starts); while recording, the call audio that can't be recorded shows on REC, the pill
  and the meeting's row ("No call audio" - never in person, where the call audio is never opened).
* Any meeting (owner decisions 2026-10-22): the card has a title box ("Meeting, Wed 22 Oct 2:05 PM" when left
  blank), "In person" / "On a call" (starting on the kind recorded last: ``prefs.kind``; the consent tick is never
  remembered) and an optional link to a calendar meeting - none by default from Record a meeting (the Meetings
  screen, the Find list); Record on a calendar meeting (Home's tile, a Day view row, the record offer) opens the
  card linked to it. A meeting not linked has no guests anywhere: no drafts, no Add block (``job_of`` hands no
  guests over; ``summary_info`` shows plain follow-ups).
* Logs: ids, kinds, counts, durations and statuses only.

Part 2, the summary: the transcript leaves this PC only when the owner asked for its summary - the start card's
own tick "summarise it" (unticked every time; the meeting keeps that he asked and when: the summary then starts
once it is written down) or his click on Summarise on the meeting. It runs through ``summary_runner`` - the
app's: the owner's own signed-in Claude Code as a planner mode run (ask.modes.MODE_MEETING), never an API key;
the transcript and the guests' names go to Anthropic that way, never the audio or an address. A run that can't
start now (Jarvis is busy with another request, a Google sign-in is open) waits in a queue and starts when the
Ask is free (``pump_summaries``, also every 30 s). ``on_summary(outcome)`` keeps a checked summary in the
meeting's summary.json (status Summary ready) or the failure's code (Retry). Opening a summary (``open_summary``)
emits ``summaryOpened(id)``: the app lends the draft cards and the Add block cards and calls ``render_summary``.
**Summarise again** on a summary (owner decision 2026-10-27: a summary from before the overview and the key points
can be redone) is the owner's click on Summarise by the same path: the summary kept stays - and opens - until the
new one is saved, and a run that fails or is cancelled leaves it (Summary ready with the failure: Retry);
``again_state`` tells the view while a run of it waits or runs. Nothing here sends, adds or keeps anything.

Tests replace ``backend_factory``, ``process_factory``, ``downloader_factory``, ``audio_missing`` and
``speech_missing`` and set ``threaded = False`` (the recorder is then ticked by the test, the download runs inline).
