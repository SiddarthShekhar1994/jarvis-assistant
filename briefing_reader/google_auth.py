"""Google sign-in per account: one OAuth client, one saved sign-in per account alias.

Jarvis signs in to each Google account it acts for ("personal", "work": the
``[accounts.<alias>]`` tables of config.toml) separately, with the same OAuth
client (README step 8), and keeps one token file per alias:

    token_path(data_dir, alias)       %LOCALAPPDATA%\\briefing-reader\\google_token_<alias>.json
    migrate_legacy_token(data_dir)    the single google_token.json of older versions becomes the
                                      "personal" account's token (moved once, never copied), so
                                      nobody has to sign in again
    GoogleAccount(alias, ...)         one account's saved sign-in: is_signed_in(), granted_features(),
                                      credentials(), sign_in(), forget(), problem(), bound_email(),
                                      identity_confirmed(), change_problem()
    AccountBindings(path)             which Google account each alias is (accounts.json)

What an account may do comes from its ``features`` (FEATURE_SCOPES):
"calendar", "gmail_send" (send only) and "gmail_read" (read only: Ask Jarvis
reads the threads a request is about; gmail.py's GmailReader, never the
sending path). Desktop apps cannot add a scope to an
existing grant, so ``sign_in()`` always asks for every scope of the account's
features (a new feature means one new, full consent). Google's consent screen
lets you untick a box: the sign-in still succeeds (OAUTHLIB_RELAX_TOKEN_SCOPE
is set just for the flow), the token is saved with the scopes Google actually
granted (so a refresh never asks for more), and a feature whose scopes were not
all granted is unavailable: ``granted_features()`` leaves it out and
``credentials(need=...)`` says so.

Which Google account an alias is: a sign-in of an account with bindings (every
alias the app builds) also asks for "openid" and "userinfo.email"
(IDENTITY_SCOPES, non-sensitive) and reads the address and Google's account id
("sub") from the id_token Google's token endpoint returns with the tokens. The
first such sign-in binds the alias to that account in
%LOCALAPPDATA%\\briefing-reader\\accounts.json (never in config.toml, never
logged); a later sign-in of the alias to another Google account, or to an
account already bound to another alias, is refused and its tokens are dropped.
The token file remembers the account id it was issued for, so
``identity_confirmed()`` (needed before Jarvis sends email) holds only while
the saved sign-in is the bound account's. A token without that (the migrated
google_token.json of older versions) still works for the calendar; sending
needs one new sign-in, which binds.

A new binding is not trusted yet: Google's account chooser makes it easy to
pick the wrong account. Until you confirm it ("Signed in as ana@example.edu
for 'work' - is that right?", ``confirm_binding``), ``pending_confirmation()``
names its address and nothing is sent or changed for the alias (gmail.py,
gcal.py and executor.py check it; reading the calendar goes on). The
confirmation is kept in accounts.json ("confirmed"), so it is asked once per
binding; a binding of an older version, without it, is asked once too.
``disconnect()`` (the dialog's "No, use another account") forgets the sign-in
and the binding, and refuses (AccountError, the binding kept) when the saved
sign-in could not be deleted. An unconfirmed binding never locks the alias: a
new sign-in with another Google account replaces it, and one that takes an
account another alias was bound to (unconfirmed) releases it there (a
confirmed binding refuses both, as above).

``change_problem()`` fails closed: a change (and email) needs a confirmed
binding whose account the saved sign-in was issued for. A saved sign-in that
names a Google account with no binding to read (accounts.json deleted, edited
by hand or unreadable; a disconnect that could not delete the token) is
PROBLEM_IDENTITY: sign in again, which binds and asks. Only a token that names
no account at all (older versions, or Google did not say) keeps changing the
calendar without a binding, as before.

Sign-in problems are told apart (``AccountError.problem``), so a card can say
what happened: no sign-in yet, the sign-in expired or was revoked
(invalid_grant: the token is deleted and the next sign-in starts fresh),
Google blocked it because the account's administrator does not allow this app
(admin_policy_enforced, org_internal), access was denied or cancelled
(access_denied), a box was unticked, or the browser sign-in timed out (Google's
"Access blocked" page does not come back to the app, so a timeout says that
this may be the reason).

``single_send_http(timeout)`` is the HTTP client for the Google services: it
sends a change (anything but GET / HEAD) at most once. httplib2 on its own
sends a request a second time when the first answer was a broken status line;
for a change that first request may already have been carried out, so the
second send is refused (RequestNotResent: an unknown outcome for the caller,
never a silent duplicate).

Everything here is blocking (the browser sign-in waits up to
``open_timeout_s``), so callers use a worker thread. Nothing here talks to
Google except ``sign_in()`` and a token refresh. Qt-free; the Google libraries
are imported lazily. Tokens, the id_token and the client secret are registered
with :func:`config.register_secret` as soon as they are read; the log names an
account only as "work", "personal" or "other", never by its address, and
messages (shown on cards, sometimes logged) never contain an address.
