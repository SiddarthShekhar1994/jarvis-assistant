"""The conversation Jarvis keeps on this PC for a day: ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\briefing-reader\\conversation.json``.

    Turn(role, text, at, tone="", context=True, note=False)   one entry as the window showed it: who said it
                                    (ROLE_YOU, the owner's request as typed; ROLE_JARVIS, Jarvis's words), when (aware),
                                    its text, the tone it was shown in and whether Ask may be given it
                                    (False: a web research's request or answer, kept on screen only). ``note``: a line
                                    of Jarvis's own for Ask's <conversation> alone, never shown (how a task ended)
    recent(turns, now)              the turns of the last KEEP (24 hours), the newest MAX_TURNS, in order
    ConversationStore(path, *, clock=None)
        turns()                     what the file held when it was read: the last 24 hours, at most
                                    MAX_TURNS, oldest first (the window shows them again at a start)
        save(turns)                 the window's conversation as it is now (older than 24 hours left out,
                                    the newest MAX_TURNS kept), written only when it changed; False when it
                                    could not be written (kept for this run only)
        prune()                     the file without its turns older than 24 hours (at the start and
                                    daily); how many left it
        clear()                     the file deleted (the Transcript's Clear conversation); False when it
                                    could not be

The window's conversation (hud.ConversationLog.kept_entries: the owner's requests, Jarvis's answers,
announcements and results, oldest first; never a memory shortcut's lines, which stay on screen only) is
what is kept, so a restart does not wipe it, and what Ask is given as <conversation> (ask.context). The
app saves it a moment after it changes, hourly (so a turn leaves the file within the hour after it turns
a day old) and at the quit. The file holds the turns only: ``{"version": 1, "turns": [{"role": "you",
"text": "...", "at": "2026-10-24T09:41:00-07:00", "tone": "done"}, ...]}`` (``"context": false`` on a web
research's turns), ASCII-escaped JSON with LF line
ends (read also with a UTF-8 BOM), written through a temporary file, fsync and ``os.replace``; each text at
most TEXT_CAP characters. A missing file is an empty conversation; so is an unreadable, corrupt, too deep
or over MAX_FILE_BYTES one (logged with the exception's type only), and the next save replaces it: it only
ever holds what the window showed. A turn the file holds in a shape Jarvis never writes is left out.

Nothing here logs a text: counts and exception type names only. Qt-free; standard library only.
