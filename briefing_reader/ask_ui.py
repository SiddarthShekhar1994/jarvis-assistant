"""Ask Jarvis in the app: the command bar's controller and the thread its planner runs on.

    AskController(config, planner, bar, *, context, blocked, calendars, live, parent)
        start()           checks Claude Code (no model request) and which accounts' mail Ask can read,
                          on the "ask" thread; the header chip and the bar follow
        submit(text)      one Ask (the bar's Enter / Ask): planner.plan() on the "ask" thread
        cancel()          ends a running Ask (the CLI is gone within a second); nothing is proposed
        refresh(full)     checks again: Claude Code and the mail after a failed run, only the mail
                          (full=False) after a Google sign-in
        shutdown()        cancels a running Ask and stops the thread (a daemon: never waited for)
    Signals (GUI thread):
        busyChanged(bool)            an Ask's planning really started (its first stage: the checks
                                     passed; the app pauses the briefing, the orb plans) / ended. An
                                     Ask refused before that (Claude Code missing or signed out, a
                                     limit) never pauses anything
        outcomeReady(object)         planner.AskOutcome of a finished Ask that was not cancelled
        askStarted(int, str)         an Ask was accepted and queued (seq, the request as typed, whitespace
                                     collapsed); never for a refused Enter (busy, empty, blocked). The
                                     app shows the request in its conversation; it is never logged
        askCancelled(int)            the Ask ``seq`` was cancelled: nothing was proposed
        chipChanged(str, str)        the header's ``claude`` chip: planner.CHIP_* and its tooltip
        mailSignInRequested(str)     the bar's link: sign this account in again so Ask may read its mail

The planner only proposes: its cards reach the app through ``outcomeReady`` and then go through the
same click, undo countdown and executor.run_action path as the briefing's. ``live`` (the app's
live.LiveStream): each accepted Ask is a LIVE view task, from "Your request" (ask.request) through
the planner's steps to "Answer and cards" (ask.cards), finished when the outcome is handed over
(or cancelled, or Jarvis closes); ``last_task_id`` is the last finished one. ``context()`` (GUI thread)
gives the briefing as Ask may see it and the briefing cards' ids; ``blocked()`` a reason not to start
now (a Google sign-in is open). Nothing here logs the request, the planner's text, the context or an
address: counts, kinds and durations only. One Ask at a time; a run that is cancelled or ends after
shutdown proposes nothing.
