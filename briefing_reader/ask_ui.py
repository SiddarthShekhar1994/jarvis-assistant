"""Ask Jarvis in the app: the command bar's controller and the thread its planner runs on.

    AskController(config, planner, bar, *, context, blocked, calendars, live, conversation, parent)
        start()           checks Claude Code (no model request) and which accounts' mail Ask can read,
                          on the "ask" thread; the header chip and the bar follow
        submit(text)      one Ask (the bar's Enter / Ask): planner.plan() on the "ask" thread
        cancel()          ends a running Ask (the CLI is gone within a second); nothing is proposed
        refresh(full)     checks again: Claude Code and the mail after a failed run, only the mail
                          (full=False) after a Google sign-in
        set_bar(bar)      binds Ask to another command bar (the desktop HUD's while it shows, the
                          window's again after): one bar at a time; it takes over what Ask shows
                          (running, Cancel, status, meta, link); on the HUD's bar a finished
                          request's answer is Jarvis's own words for where it is (HUD_IN_APPROVALS,
                          HUD_IN_WINDOW) - only a plain answer whose words it showed as they were written stays
        shutdown()        cancels a running Ask and stops the thread (a daemon: never waited for)
    Signals (GUI thread):
        busyChanged(bool)            an Ask's planning really started (its first stage: the checks
                                     passed; the app pauses the briefing, the orb plans) / ended. An
                                     Ask refused before that (Claude Code missing or signed out, a
                                     limit) never pauses anything
        outcomeReady(object)         planner.AskOutcome of a finished Ask that was not cancelled
        askStarted(int, str)         an Ask was accepted and queued (seq, the request as typed, whitespace
                                     collapsed); never for a refused Enter (busy, empty, blocked). The
                                     app shows the request in its conversation (and the bar is cleared
                                     at once: bar.take_request); it is never logged
        askCancelled(int)            the Ask ``seq`` was cancelled: nothing was proposed
        chipChanged(str, str)        the header's ``claude`` chip: planner.CHIP_* and its tooltip
        mailSignInRequested(str)     the bar's link: sign this account in again so Ask may read its mail
        memoryRequested(object, str) a typed memory shortcut (ask.routes: "remember that ...", "forget
                                     that ...", "what do you remember?") and the words as typed: the app
                                     handles it at once - no planner run, no caps, no askStarted
        followupsRequested(str)      a typed "any follow-ups?" (ask.routes FOLLOWUPS) and the words as
                                     typed: the app answers from its follow-up list at once (no run)
        sayWritten(int, int, str, str, bool, bool)  an Ask's say as it is written (ask.stream.SayWatch; never a mode's):
                                     seq, run number, the words so far, what the caption may show of them
                                     (persona.ask_say_shown; "" while it may show nothing), whether it is whole, and
                                     whether that run's stdin had mail. Never after a Cancel. Never logged
        askStopping(int)             Cancel was clicked: the Ask's words stop now (askCancelled follows when the run has
                                     ended, within a second)

An Ask's words come before its answer (sayWritten), and on the HUD's bar they are the caption line; the final
validated answer stays the source of truth (``outcomeReady``; on the HUD's bar: HUD_IN_APPROVALS when it proposed
something, a question back HUD_IN_WINDOW, else the final say's words). Ahead of the question: after each readiness check
and every SWEEP_EVERY_S the planner may prepare an idle Claude Code (planner.prestart_ask / prestart_sweep, only with its
prestart seam: the app's), and as the owner starts typing it reads the calendars an Ask would read (planner.read_ahead,
at most every READ_AHEAD_EVERY_S). shutdown() kills what waits.

The planner only proposes: its cards reach the app through ``outcomeReady`` and then go through the
same click, Undo and executor.run_action path as the briefing's. ``live`` (the app's
live.LiveStream): each accepted Ask is a LIVE view task, from "Your request" (ask.request) through
the planner's steps to "Answer and cards" (ask.cards), finished when the outcome is handed over
(or cancelled, or Jarvis closes); ``last_task_id`` is the last finished one. ``context()`` (GUI thread)
gives the briefing as Ask may see it and the briefing cards' ids; ``blocked()`` a reason not to start
now (a Google sign-in is open). ``conversation()`` (GUI thread) gives what was said before (the window's
conversation.Turn list of the last day): taken as an Ask is accepted - before its own words join it -
and handed to planner.plan() for its <conversation> block; "Your request" says how many earlier
exchanges that is (ask.context.conversation_exchanges: a count only). Never for web research or a
planner mode. Nothing here logs the request, the planner's text, the context, the conversation or an
address: counts, kinds and durations only. One Ask at a time; a run that is cancelled or ends after
shutdown proposes nothing.

The bar (R23): a request typed there that Jarvis accepts - an Ask or a typed mode is queued, a memory
or follow-ups shortcut is taken - leaves the bar at once (bar.take_request: its words are in the
conversation; Up in the empty bar brings them back). One that is not accepted (busy, blocked, empty,
Jarvis closing) keeps its words, and one the planner refuses before any run (a limit, Claude Code not
ready, web research off) gets them back while the bar is still empty (bar.give_back). An outcome never
clears the bar, so nothing typed later is wiped, and a click-started run (an offer, a choice) never
touches what the owner may be typing.

Typed routes (the productivity bundle, ``route_flags``): after the stop and empty checks and when the
text does not start with "web:", ask.routes.route() decides; a memory route is handed to the app
(``memoryRequested``) before the busy and blocked checks. The bar emits only while idle (it is
read-only while a request runs), so in practice a memory route arrives when nothing runs; MEMORY's
own Add field saves a note meanwhile. ``memory(command)`` (the notes the planner would get for the
request - every note while they fit, else the closest to it first - and how many were left out) adds
"Memory given" to each Ask's "Your request" step. A plan route ("plan my day")
goes through the busy and blocked checks and starts a planner mode run: submit_mode(request, words)
(also what a click on an offer calls) runs planner.plan_mode() on the ask thread with
``mode_inputs()`` (the app's to-dos and deadlines, read on the GUI thread) as a LIVE task of the
mode's own kind (live.TASK_PLAN) whose first step is "Your request" (live.MODE_REQUEST). Its
outcome comes through ``outcomeReady`` like an Ask's (AskOutcome.mode set). Only a run typed into
the bar ever clears the bar's text, as it starts (R23): a click-started run leaves what the owner
was typing. A prep route ("prep me for my 2 PM") is a planner mode run the same way
(live.TASK_PREP): its words only pick the meeting (ModeRequest.target) and never reach Claude. A
follow-up draft (live.TASK_NUDGE) is only ever click-started (a FOLLOW-UPS row, a brief's "Draft a
nudge", "Tell Jarvis what to say"): submit_mode with ModeRequest(MODE_NUDGE, ...), so it never clears
the bar.

A desktop request (ask.routes ROUTE_DESKTOP, only while [desktop] is on: clear desktop verbs) goes to the
app first (``desktop_request(text)``): from the window's bar Jarvis goes onto the HUD, where the request
continues on the desktop thread (desktop_ui; meanwhile the app's ``blocked`` refuses any other request); a local
route is carried out there on this PC (no planner run); anything else comes back later as an
ask.desktop_mode.DesktopJob, which the app runs through ``submit_mode`` as ONE planner mode run (MODE_DESKTOP,
live.TASK_DESKTOP, its first step desktop.request) - typed, so its words leave the bar as it starts (R23: the app
takes a local route's words itself, and a request from the window's bar leaves it and goes on in the HUD's). It gets
no notes and no conversation (owner decision D6: names only). Its checked plan is carried out through the desktop
thread before the run ends (AskOutcome.desktop_run), and its answer on the bar is Jarvis's own words for what came
of it (AskOutcome.message), never Claude's say or question; a Cancel after something opened still says what did.

Web research: a request that starts with "web:" (or "research:") is a WEB task (live.TASK_WEB;
``running_kind``) whose "Your request" says nothing is read from the accounts; the command still
goes to planner.plan() as typed, which runs only the research (ask.research). A request the
planner hands over to research stays in its ASK task. While the research runs the bar says
"Searching the web... N s"; its outcome (AskOutcome.research) ends the task with the cards in the
words every view uses (research_validate.cards_words: "2 source cards + 1 proposal"; CHECK when a
source or a suggestion was left out), and the "Answer and cards" step lists the sources' cards as
"ASK WEB - <site> - [n] <title>". Web research is part of Ask: it counts against the Ask caps and
its own ([research] max_per_hour, max_per_day); after a research (or its limit) the meta line shows
the web research runs left, and the research limit is its own kind (planner.RESEARCH_LIMIT).
